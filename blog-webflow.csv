How to Target Phonological Processes in Articulation Station,how-to-target-phonological-processes-in-articulation-station,Little Bee,2013-07-11,Early Language Development,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phono_processes_01.jpg,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phonological_processes.jpg"" alt=""How To Target Phonological Processes in Articulation Station - Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""632"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-110"" />

<strong>Update:</strong> After many years of supporting SLPs all over the world, Articulation Station Classic has been officially retired, and is no longer available for download on the App Store. It has been replaced with <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/articulation-station-hive/id1485607474"" title=""Articulation Station Hive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>, which has even more phonological process options than Articulation Station Classic. You can learn more about Articulation Station Hive <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>.

If you are looking for a good app to target phonological processes you will be pleased to know that Articulation Station does that too! Now you may be thinking,”I haven’t seen phonological processes on any of the menus in Articulation Station,” and you’re right. There are no menus with the phonological processes laid out and predetermined for you. Instead, Articulation Station puts the Speech Language Pathologist in the driver's seat, knowing that each client is different with their own specific needs. Some clients may even have a very specific set of words that need to be targeted within a phonological process. If that’s the case, no problem you can customize Articulation Station to meet their needs. Here’s how it works.

To begin, select the multiple sounds activity button at the bottom of the home screen.  This button looks like a speech bubble with a plus sign on the side of it. Multiple sounds can then be selected to be included in word lists targeting phonological processes. 

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phono_processes_01.jpg"" alt=""phono_processes_01"" width=""690"" height=""518"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-103"" />

For example, let’s say we are working with little Billy who exhibits the phonological process of stopping with the sounds /s/ /z/ and /sh/ in speech, we can select these sounds from the left side of the screen. Then we select the sound position we want to target these sounds in. 

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phono_processes_02.jpg"" alt=""phono_processes_02"" width=""690"" height=""518"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-104"" />

Once we have selected all the sounds, and sound positions we want included in our list we can press the “list” icon in the bottom right corner to edit the list further. This will allow us to choose the specific words we want to be included in the list.

Notice that all of the words are selected by default.  Words can be selected or deselected by tapping each one individually, or by pressing the “deselect all” button in the bottom left corner and then selecting the words to be included in the targeted phonological process.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phono_processes_04.jpg"" alt=""phonological_processes_04"" width=""690"" height=""518"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-106"" />

Here, we have selected the words we would like to practice with little Billy for the phonological process of stopping. After we have selected the words, we can click on the “save list” button and give the list a name.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phono_processes_051.jpg"" alt=""phonological_processes_05"" width=""690"" height=""518"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-117"" />

This list will be saved under “Saved Word Lists” to access now, or later. Notice we can also come back and edit our lists from this screen as well.  Select the word list by tapping it and then press begin to review the customized list. 

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phono_processes_07.jpg"" alt=""phonological_processes_07"" width=""690"" height=""518"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-109"" />

The name of the customized list appears on the right side so that it can be identified during the therapy session. 

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/phono_processes_06.jpg"" alt=""phonological_processes_06"" width=""690"" height=""518"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-108"" />

The name of the customized list also will be listed next to the student’s score on their data sheet for easy data tracking.

Hopefully this helps you better understand the “Multiple Sounds” feature in Articulation Station and how it gives you the freedom to create client specific word lists for children with phonological disorders as well as children with other speech and language disorders. The ability to create custom lists in the “Multiple Sounds” program is a favorite feature among our users.  

We hope all you fabulous SLP’s will take advantage of this powerful feature as you create lists to meet the needs of your students!

Using Articulation Test Center to assess Articulation and Phonological Delays,articulation-test-center,Little Bee,2016-09-01,Articulation,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ATC_full_test.jpg,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_1-1.png"" alt=""ATC - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019"" />

We're thrilled to announce our newest member of the Little Bee Speech app family...  

<strong>Articulation Test Center!</strong> 

Articulation Test Center is an articulation and phonology test for your iPad and was designed for speech-language pathologists to assess the articulation and speech production of their students.

Articulation Test Center allows the user to customize the test to test only age appropriate sounds or to test specific areas of speech while still delivering comprehensive test results. Speech sound norms, intelligibility measures and the age at which phonological processes are eliminated are reported in the results and are based on normative data available in the research. All research considered is cited in the app in the results section and in the generated email report.

Articulation Test Center is divided into 2 different tests, a Screener and a Full Test.

<strong>Screener</strong>
The Screener was designed to quickly determine whether a chid's speech sound errors are considered delayed or age appropriate. Simply select the screener based on the age of the child being screened and with a simple tap mark sounds as correct, incorrect or approximate. At the completion of the screener you can view a full report including sound errors marked and recommendations for practice.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_02.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022"" />

<strong>Full Test</strong>
The Full Test has more testing options which allows the test administrator to customize the test to meet the needs of the student being tested. With the Full Test you can mark sound errors as incorrect or approximate. In addition you can mark sound omissions, substitutions, distortions and phonological processes present. The option of recording a speech sample is also available with three beautifully illustrated scenes to explore.

Speech professionals will greatly appreciate the detailed results including speech norms next to errors marked and phonological processes marked, a record of substitutions made, a place to transcribe speech samples, a written report (automatically generated!) and recommendations for practice.

We'll outline the Full Test in this post so that you can see how the app works.

<strong>How it Works:</strong>
Select the test based on the needs of the student you are working with. Select “Full Test” to quickly select everything or simply tap on the options you wish to test then tap Begin Test.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_03.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023"" />

<strong>How to Score Correct, Incorrect or Approximate:</strong>
Each stimulus card in the app shows a clear, easy to interpret image with the name of the image spelled with square tiles at the top of the card. The green tiles are the sounds that are being tested. The sound being tested is also displayed phonetically below each green scoring tile. In the case of ""piano"", we see the initial /p/, medial /n/, and final /o/ sounds are being tested.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_07.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031"" />

<strong>Marking Sounds as Correct:</strong>
By default, the scoring tiles are green, marking the sounds tested as correct. If no speech errors are made on the sounds tested simply proceed to the next card by swiping to the left.

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-172"" alt=""ATC_02"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ATC_02.jpg"" width=""690"" height=""142"" />

<strong>Marking Sounds as Incorrect:</strong>
If a sound being tested is said incorrectly tap the tile once and it will turn red marking the sound as incorrect.

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-173"" alt=""ATC_03"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ATC_03.jpg"" width=""690"" height=""164"" />

<strong>Marking Sounds as Approximate:</strong>
Another tap will turn it from red to yellow marking it as “approximate.”
To mark a sound tile as correct again one more tap will turn the tile from yellow to green.

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-174"" alt=""ATC_04"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ATC_04.jpg"" width=""690"" height=""164"" />

<strong>Marking Omissions, Substitutions, Distortions and Phonological Processes:</strong>

<strong>Marking Sound Omissions</strong>
To mark a sound as omitted simply swipe the sound tile up and off the screen. If you delete a sound tile by mistake, simply tap the deleted symbol and the scoring tile will reappear.

<img class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-175"" alt=""ATC_05"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ATC_05.jpg"" width=""690"" height=""235"" />

To mark a substitution, distortion and/or phonological process tap the down arrow to the right of the scoring tiles to open the substitutions menu.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_08.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033"" />

To mark a substitution drag the sound tile of the sound that was said and drop it on top of the tile of the sound being substituted.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_09.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1035"" />

To mark a phonological process tap the phonological process tab at the bottom of the substitution menus, then select the phonological process type: substitution, assimilation or syllable structure. Then drag and drop the process name over the scoring tile where a phonological process has been used.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_10.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1037"" />

When a phonological process is tapped, reference information will come in from the right with a quick definition of the process, an example of what it may look like in the speech of a child and an approximate age of elimination.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_11.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1039"" />

Just like deleting a sound tile, to remove a phonological process marked or substitution marked simply drag it up and off the screen.

<strong>Recording:</strong>
Tap the red record button in the lower left hand corner of the screen to record the student’s speech. Press stop when the recording is complete. Press play to play back the student’s production.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_12.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041"" />

Each recording will be saved and associated with the word being tested. At any time during the test you may go back to previous testing cards and play back the recording associated with that card.

<strong>Taking Notes:</strong>
If there is something unique about the student’s speech production and you’d like to make a note of it, tap the notes icon located in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then type your note. When finished, tap the “X” to close the notes and the note will be saved and associated with that particular stimulus card. Once a test is saved you can review your notes in the report screen.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_14.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043"" />

<strong>Adjusting the Settings:</strong>
To adjust the settings tap on the settings button in the lower right corner of the screen. Here you have several options to modify the test.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_13.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042"" />

<strong>Settings Options</strong>
- Voice Prompt:
Turning off the “voice prompt” will eliminate the voice recording that describes the card when the card is tapped.

- Stimulus Word:
Turning off the “stimulus word” will remove the written word from the bottom of the testing card.

- Stimulus Image:
Turning off the “stimulus image” will remove the picture from the testing card and replace it with large written text.

- Record Button:
Turning off the “record button” will remove the record button from the screen.

- Sound Effects:
Turning off the “sound effects” will eliminate sound effects associated with the buttons.

<strong>Completing the Test:</strong>
When all the testing cards have been scored and you have reached the “Success!” card tap the “Done” button. If you tap “Done” before you have gone through all the cards in the test, the test will be considered incomplete. You may quit without saving or pause and save the test to complete at a later time.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_15.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1044"" />

When you have completed the testing cards you will have the option to add a speech sample if you did not already choose to.

<strong>Speech Sample:</strong>
The speech sample portion of the test can be used to assess the following:

- intelligibility
- articulation skills in conversation
- language skills including syntax, semantics, morphology, and pragmatics 
- a child’s Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)
- fluency sample

<strong>To Begin the Speech Sample:</strong>
Start by selecting the speech scene you want to explore from the three speech scenes provided:
- Mountain Adventure
- Beach Day
- Fun at the Park... then tap “Next”.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_16.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""690"" height=""539"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1047"" />

When the speech scene comes in you will hear environmental sounds playing in the background to enhance the experience. These sounds may be turned off/on at any time while exploring the scene by tapping the audio button in the upper right corner of the screen.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ATC_17.jpg"" alt=""ATC_17"" width=""690"" height=""551"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-215"" />

To record a speech sample tap the microphone in the lower left corner of the screen, then tap record. Once the recording is started an indicator below the microphone will keep track of the length of the recording.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_17.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""690"" height=""350"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1049"" />

To explore the full scene swipe the screen from right to left. Tap on the images in the scene to enlarge the images and view a language prompt to help keep your students talking.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ATC_231.jpg"" alt=""ATC_23"" width=""690"" height=""502"" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-229"" />

<strong>Rating Intelligibility:</strong>
Rating the intelligibility is a useful way to compare the child’s speech comprehensibility over time. It can also be used to help determine the presence and severity of a speech delay.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_18.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""690"" height=""282"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050"" />

Using your best judgement determine how intelligible the student’s speech is.

Mark “Good” if more than 90% of their words can be clearly understood.

Mark “Fair” if 60- 90% of their words can be clearly understood.

Mark “Poor” if less than 60% of their words can be clearly understood.

<strong>Results
Main Data Screen:</strong>
The main data screen will display a summary of all tests given to that child. It will include the test date, age of the child on the test date, the name of the test given, the overall score, the intelligibility rating, and whether the test is complete or incomplete.

<strong>Test Details:</strong>
From the main data screen tap the test you wish to view for more test details.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ipad_screenshot_19.png"" alt=""Articulation Test Center - Little Bee Speech Blog"" width=""700"" height=""467"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1052"" />

<strong>Words Tested:</strong>
The first screen that you will see will display all the words tested and how the words were marked. It will also allow you to listen to recordings made and view any notes taken. If you feel you have scored something incorrectly you can tap the ""Edit Results"" button in the top right corner of the screen. This will take you back into the test and allow you to make any changes necessary. Once you have made your changes and you are satisfied that everything is scored correctly tap ""done"" and your changes will be saved.

The ""Edit Results"" button can also be a huge time saver. For example, if you are short on time when giving a test or you have a student with a short attention span you can administer the test and record the student's responses on each stimulus card by using the audio recording feature of the app (no need to score anything at this time). When finished, you can save the test and when you have the time later, go back to the test, tap the Edit Results button and you can now review each recording and score the student's responses accordingly.

<strong>Errors Marked:</strong>
The next tab is a representation of the errors marked in the test. There are three sub tabs in this section, sound errors, substitutions and processes/ distortions.

<strong>Sound Errors:</strong>
The “Sound Errors” will display all the sounds that were marked as “incorrect” and “approximate” during the test. You will also see the age at which those sounds should be mastered.

<strong>Speech Sample:</strong>
The “Speech Sample” tab is where the audio recording sample taken from the speech scene activity will be saved and available to play back. When the recording is played back the test administrator can transcribe the speech sample to obtain a more accurate intelligibility rating as well as determine MLU and assess language skills if desired.

<strong>Intelligibility Rating:</strong>
You can leave the intelligibility as Good, Fair or Poor or, if a speech sample was done you can update the intelligibility to a more accurate measure by tapping on the intelligibility/ transcription buttons in the speech sample section. Then tap the ""+"" button for every word you understand and the ""-""button for every word you don’t understand. When you finish you will have the option to update the intelligibility score to reflect a percentage in the report.

<strong>Report:</strong>
If you tap the “Report,” tab you will be able to view a full, detailed written report summarizing the results of the test. This report is automatically generated by the app. We spent a lot of time developing and adding all the essential details to this report. The data you collect is very important and we believe a report should reflect this and be easy to read and understand. It's also a HUGE time saver!

<strong>Recommendation:</strong>
If you tap the tab, “Recommendation,” you will see a quick summary of any sounds recommended for practice and any sounds that should be monitored for appropriate development.

You will also see a link to our app Articulation Station (available for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch) which offers 6 engaging activities for targeted articulation practice using words, sentences and stories.

New Research on Using Speech Therapy Software for Home Practice,new-research-on-using-speech-therapy-software-for-home-practice,Little Bee,2014-12-16,Research,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/home_use_frequency.png,"<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-335"" alt=""New Research on Using Speech Therapy Software for Home Practice"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/research.png"" width=""688"" height=""460"" />

As SLPs and developers of apps for speech and language, our interest is always piqued when new information is available on patient technology usage. We were excited to see that Software Advice, a leading software <a href=""http://www.softwareadvice.com/medical/speech-therapy-comparison/"" target=""_blank"">review and research</a> company, created a survey to get a sampling of information from speech therapy patients about how they are using available technology in their therapy practice at home. Based on how the respondents answered, we can gain some important insights into how technology can be effectively used when integrated responsibly into an existing speech therapy plan.

Respondents were asked to complete a six-question survey online. 2,193 responses were gathered from people in the United States, who had attended therapy within the last two years. The respondents included adult speech therapy patients and parents of child patients. All survey questionnaires underwent an internal peer review process to ensure clarity in wording.

Below are some of the key findings that Software Advice included in their <a href=""http://www.softwareadvice.com/medical/industryview/home-speech-therapy-report-2014/"" title=""Patient Home Usage of Speech Therapy Software"" target=""_blank"">final report</a>:

<strong>1. Three-quarters (74%) of speech therapy patients used software to practice at home as compared to 26% who don’t.

2. The majority (89%) of patients that used software for home practice noticed some improvements.

3. Most respondents were more likely to choose a therapist-recommended at-home practice solution.</strong>

<a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/home_use_frequency.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-326"" alt=""home_use_frequency"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/home_use_frequency.png"" width=""658"" height=""492"" /></a>


“Speech therapy software is really altering the way patients think about home practice,” says Software Advice market researcher, Gaby Loria. “Traditional techniques like flashcard exercises and articulation drills are giving way to interactive, digital approaches to improving communication. Our data shows adult and child patients alike are using speech therapy software in large numbers, with nearly three-quarters of respondents using the technology and nearly half of them practicing with it daily.”

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-330"" alt=""graph_frequency"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/graph_frequency.png"" width=""658"" height=""492"" />

Perhaps most striking, however, was the fact that the overwhelming majority of respondents (89 percent) noticed improvements after using speech therapy software. “There are big implications here for everyone in the speech-language pathology community. For patients, it means this technology can boost confidence in their progress, making them more positive about treatment outcomes. For therapists, it is a way to build encouragement that motivates patients to practice between sessions. For vendors, it is proof that these digital practice methods are resonating with users,” Loria said.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-331"" alt=""graph_improvement"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/graph_improvement.png"" width=""658"" height=""296"" />

This information is valuable for SLPs because it illustrates that the majority of patients are responding to therapy integrated with applicable technology in the form of software and apps. Though this technology should never replace the expert advice and knowledge that we possess as SLPs, we can all agree that technology isn’t going anywhere; in fact we encounter and interact with it often on a daily basis. As therapists trying to maximize functional communication interaction with our patients, we would be remiss if we didn’t familiarize ourselves with available technology and work to utilize it in our patients’ therapy plan, where we feel it would enhance their outcomes appropriately.

We hope that the research behind the effectiveness of responsible technology usage in speech therapy continues, and that more information becomes available to help further guide practice for maximum therapy results.

Using Articulation Station Pro to Target the R Sound,using-articulation-station-pro-to-target-the-r-sound,Little Bee,2015-04-13,Articulation,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_sound.jpeg,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_sound.jpeg"" alt=""R sound Articulation Station"" width=""694"" height=""500"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-419"" />

<strong>Update:</strong> After many years of supporting SLPs all over the world, Articulation Station Pro Classic has been officially retired, and is no longer available for download on the App Store. It has been replaced with <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/articulation-station-hive/id1485607474"" title=""Articulation Station Hive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>, which includes an extensive range of new content and activities, including the R sound.

When it comes to speech therapy, the R sound has quite the reputation of being a difficult sound to remediate. This particular sound can prove to be very challenging for children, parents, and speech-language pathologists alike due to its complex nature. Not only is R a later developing sound (typically around the age of 5), but also it has different ways that it can be articulated (retroflexed /r/ vs. bunched /r/), and the variations of articulation when R is vowel controlled or occurs in a blend. Many SLPs find it helpful to breakdown the R sound by position (initial, medial, and final or prevocalic and postvocalic) and by its specific phonetic variations (pre-vocalic R, vocalic R, or R-blends) when targeting it in therapy.

<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articulation-station-pro/id491998279?mt=8"" title=""Articulation Station Pro"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Articulation Station Pro</a> has many comprehensive features built-in to the app to help aid in the targeting and remediation of R. Its user-friendly layout makes it the perfect tool for SLPs with a busy caseload, or a parent wanting to practice at home with their child.

The R sound program in <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articulation-station/id467415882?mt=8"" title=""Articulation Station"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Articulation Station</a> and <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articulation-station-pro/id491998279?mt=8"" title=""Articulation Station Pro"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Articulation Station Pro</a> contains target stimuli for R in pre-vocalic, or initial position, as well as vocalic R sounds: air, ar, ear, ire, or, and er in the initial, medial, and final positions. All of the R consonant blends are included, even the tricky /rl/ sound that many children struggle with saying correctly. Ultimately, the R program contains 176 target words for children to practice their R sounds.

Once children master the correct articulation of R in words, the program contains other levels of practice for children to carryover their skills, including: 176 unique phrases, 176 unique sentences, and 54 stories, all that contain R. This ensures that children will have numerous exposures to the R sound they are targeting in their individual therapy plan, and the app’s interactive nature helps take away some of the redundancy that can occur in therapy. Add to that the distinctive features found in Articulation Station Pro, such as its comprehensive data collection capabilities for progress monitoring; voice recording for the benefit of playback for auditory feedback; its beautiful images used for targeted stimuli; the ability for SLPs to use it for group therapy; and the priceless feature of being able to add custom images and word lists; and you have an amazing tool that can help in the process of correcting the big, bad R.

We are excited to announce the release of Articulation Station Pro v2.0! This long awaited release brings phrases and phonological processes to our favorite articulation app.

<strong>Rotating Phrases</strong>

The phrases are included in two new activities, rotating phrases and unique phrases. These are also available in Articulation Station. The rotating phrases are two-word phrases with a “lead word” and a “target word.” The lead word proceeds the target word with words like, “my, his, hers, big, little, hot or cold.”  The target word has the target sound in the targeted sound position. Both the lead words and the target words spin producing hundreds of silly and fun phrase combinations like, “happy socks,” and “hello balloons.” 

<center><img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/021.png"" alt=""Articulation Station v2.0 Update"" width=""600"" height=""484"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-463"" /></center>

You can choose which lead words and target words you want included in the activity by tapping on the custom list icon in the bottom right hand corner of the screen before beginning the activity. You can even add your own lead word by selecting “+ add word” at the bottom of the “Lead Words” column in custom lists (only available when all sounds are purchased and in Articulation Station Pro).

For example, adding the child’s name could produce the following phrase combination, “Heidi’s salad,” or ""Heidi's sofa"".

If you are working in a rotating phrase activity and you decide you want to focus on one lead word, or one target word you can lock the spin buttons by tapping and holding the spin button until it locks.

An example of when locking the spin button might be helpful would be when there is one particular target word the child really struggles with. You could lock the spin button on that word (to stop little tap happy fingers) and then continue to spin the lead words giving you lots of different opportunities to practice the target word in new phrase combinations. For example if the child was struggling with the word ""rabbit"" and you locked the spin button on “rabbit” and continue to spin the lead words. You could get phrase combinations like, “my rabbit"" ""little rabbit"" and ""pretty rabbit.”

<strong>Unique Phrases</strong>

The unique phrases are three-word phrases that are different every time. The phrases are generally descriptive phrases which provides the added benefit of being able to work on language goals and articulation at the same time. For example, “hot pepperoni pizza,” and “little lion cub.” Like in the other activities you can customize your list by tapping on the custom list icon before beginning the activity.

<strong>Phonological Processes</strong>

Phonological Processes are accessed by tapping on the red phonological processes button on the bottom right corner of the home screen (only available when all sounds are purchased and in Articulation Station Pro).

For phonological processes definitions, examples and ages of elimination you can tap on the question icon in the upper right hand corner of the phonological processes menu.

After you have selected the process you’d like to target you can choose to practice them at the word level in the flashcard or matching activity. 

We've also added Retina image support in v2.0, which means the app will look even prettier on those iPads with Retina (high resolution) screens!

As mentioned above, there are several features that are only available if all sounds have been purchased in Articulation Station or with Articulation Station Pro. These features are:

<strong>- Adding Lead Words in Rotating Phrases
- Targeting Phonological Processes
- Adding your own custom images</strong>

We hope you will enjoy these new features in version 2.0 of Articulation Station and Articulation Station Pro and we would like to invite you to please take a moment to review the app in the App Store. Doing so will help others as they consider Articulation Station, and hearing your feedback will also help us to continue to improve this app and make it the best it can be.

Is the Tablet an Effective Therapy Tool for Speech-Language Pathologists?,is-the-tablet-an-effective-therapy-tool-for-speech-language-pathologists,Little Bee,2015-09-08,Articulation Station,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/graph_1.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/header2.png"" alt=""Study - Using Tablets in Speech Therapy"" width=""678"" height=""494"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-775"" />
One of the most rewarding things about developing mobile applications for speech and language is hearing feedback from the users of our apps. We recently had the pleasure of hearing from a school district in the United States that conducted their own “Tablet Pilot Study” to help determine if purchasing tablets and apps for their Speech-Language Pathologists would be effective. 

The following questions were addressed in the study:

<strong>1. Is the tablet an effective therapy tool for Speech-Language Pathologists?
2. Does the tablet serve as a sustained motivational tool for the student in Speech Therapy?
3. Does the tablet serve as an accurate and effective administrative tool for the Speech-Language Pathologist?
4. Which Platform is best: iPad (iOS) or Android?</strong>

This school district graciously shared the results of their study with us and with their permission we are excited to share their findings with you. We hope this helps you, your school, or district with deciding on whether to incorporate tablets into your therapy setting.

Here are the results of their study taken directly from the documents shared with us:

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Speech-Language Pathology
Tablet Pilot Study Results
April 2014 </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<strong>TABLET PILOT STUDY</strong>

In the spring of 2013, the district approved a tablet pilot program proposed by the Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) Technology Professional Learning Community leaders. In May 2013, 12 iPads and 5 Android tablets were delivered to 17 Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) throughout the district. The third generation iPad was used in this study. The schools chosen for the study were carefully selected to include a variety of participants across grade levels and geographic locations. SLPs participating in the study completed surveys regarding the use of their tablets for therapeutic activities and for case management activities. The purpose of the tablet pilot program was to answer the three questions outlined below regarding the use of tablet technology in the field of school-based Speech-Language Pathology. In addition to these three questions, iPad and Android data were compared in order to determine which tablet is more beneficial to SLPs. Data was collected between August 2013 and January 2014. 67 responses were collected regarding iPads and 12 responses were collected regarding Android tablets.

All of the tablets were preloaded with carefully chosen apps before they were distributed to the SLPs. Criteria for choosing an app was based on: previous experience with tablets, two workshops by Penina Rybak, MA, CCC-SLP entitled “Meet Your iPad: Essentials for the Busy Educator” and “Using iPad Apps for Play Skills, Intervention, &amp; Lesson Plans in Early Childhood Special Education” sponsored by HEALTH EDucation Network, LLC., and recommendations from blogs and other online resources. An app rubric was used to select apps based on the following domains: curriculum connection, authenticity, feedback, differentiation, user friendliness, student motivation, and reporting. Apps loaded onto Android tablets were either the same as their iPad counterparts or similar; some apps available on iPad were not available for Android.

<strong>QUESTIONS POSED</strong>

<strong>1. Is the tablet an effective therapy tool for Speech-Language Pathologists?
</strong>
After using one of the carefully chosen therapy apps in therapy, SLPs were asked “How effective was this app?” on a scale of 1 (very ineffective) to 10 (very effective). Results were as follows. iPad apps averaged a rating of 8.81 and Android apps averaged a rating of 6.23. iPad apps were 41% more effective than Android apps in the treatment of speech and language disorders. SLPs were also asked “Compared to traditional therapy tools, how effective was the use of this app?” on a scale of 1 (a lot less effective than traditional therapy tools) to 10 (a lot more effective than traditional therapy tools). iPad apps averaged a rating of 8.43 and Android apps averaged a rating of 5.85. iPad apps were 44% more effective than Android apps as compared to traditional therapy materials (e.g. board games, folder games, flash cards).

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/graph_1.png"" alt=""iPad vs. Android - Speech Therapy"" width=""665"" height=""573"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-711"" />

Based on the results of the surveys, tablets are an effective therapy tool and appear to be as or more effective than traditional therapy materials. Anecdotal information from the surveys supports this outcome. 

For example, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/articulation-station-pro/id491998279?mt=8"" target=""_blank"">""Articulation Station""</a> is a fun and engaging app for the students that the Speech-Language Pathologist can use to target articulation practice. It can be used to gather baseline data, to provide opportunities to remediate production of a variety of phonemes, and to show progress after therapy. Students are self-motivated to produce the sounds to the best of their abilities."" In addition, the data collected suggests that iPads are a more effective therapy tool than Android tablets.


<strong>2. Does the tablet serve as a sustained motivational tool for the student in Speech Therapy?</strong>

After using one of the carefully chosen apps in therapy, SLPs were asked “How motivating was this app to your student?” on a scale of 1 (very un-motivating) to 10 (very motivating). iPad apps averaged a rating of 8.90 and Android apps averaged a rating of 6.54. iPad apps were 36% more effective than Android apps in the area of student motivation. SLPs were also asked “Compared to traditional therapy tools, how motivated was your student to participate in therapy activities?” on a scale of 1 (a lot less motivated than traditional therapy tools) to 10 (a lot more motivated than traditional therapy tools). iPad apps averaged a rating of 8.79 and Android apps averaged a rating of 6.69. iPad apps were 63% more effective than Android apps as compared to traditional therapy materials (e.g. board games, folder games, flash cards), and iPad apps were 67% more effective than Android apps in the area of student motivation.

Based on the results of the surveys listed above, tablets are an effective way of motivating students to participate in therapy activities. One SLP reported, ""Students are motivated to participate while using <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-playhome/id439628153?mt=8"" target=""_blank"">""My PlayHome""</a> and the Speech-Language Pathologist can easily use it to target a variety of language skills with young children in one setting."" Another SLP stated, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speech-with-milo-sequencing/id431803095?mt=8"" target=""_blank"">""Sequencing with Milo""</a> is highly motivating to a variety of younger students because of the simple display, familiar routines, and auditory praise/feedback for the students. The SLP is able to target a variety of goal areas while keeping the student engaged and learning."" In addition, the data collected suggests that iPads are more motivating to students than Android tablets.

<strong>3. Does the tablet serve as an accurate and effective administrative tool for the Speech-Language Pathologist? </strong>

The SLPs participating in this trial tablet study were given a separate questionnaire to complete regarding case management apps. Case management involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting data, collaborating with parents, teachers, and other professionals, and other tasks related to completing paperwork. After using one of the carefully chosen therapy or case management apps for case management purposes, SLPs were asked “Was this app successful,” SLPs using iPad apps answered ‘Yes’ 89.66% of the time, while Android apps received a ‘yes’ answer 50% of the time. SLPs were asked “How effective was this app for case management purposes?” on a scale of 1 (very ineffective) to 10 (very effective). iPad apps averaged a rating of 8.38 and Android apps averaged a rating of 5.00. SLPs were also asked “Compared to traditional case management tools, how effective was the use of this app for case management purposes?” on a scale of 1 (a lot less effective than traditional case management tools) to 10 (a lot more effective than traditional case management tools). iPad apps averaged a rating of 8.07 and Android apps averaged a rating of 5.00. iPad apps were 61% more effective than Android apps as compared to traditional case management tools.

Based on the results of the surveys, tablets are an effective tool in case management. According to anecdotal report, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-duper-data-tracker/id432397161?mt=8"" target=""_blank"">""The Super Duper Data Tracker""</a> iPad application increases the accuracy and efficiency of speech therapy data collection for a picture of the student’s present level of achievement and functional performance. The professional report and graphing features provide visuals for showing growth and progress following a period of therapeutic intervention to parents and teachers during the school year. The report data is also useful for monthly Medicaid billing as the application calculates percentages of response types for each student’s goal for progress documentation."" In addition, the data collected suggests that iPads are a more effective tablet in the case management process than Android tablets.

<strong>WHICH PLATFORM IS BEST - iPad (iOS) or Android?</strong>

Comments on the forms indicated the lower scores on the Android apps may be attributed to the different platform. SLPs provided with Android tablets reported using the same or similar app on their personal iPad and would give the app a higher rating on that platform compared to the Android. One participant explained the difference between using her personal iPad and using her school Android in speech therapy. She stated her iPad was more effective than her Android for four reasons. First, the iPad’s battery life was longer and it works more consistently than the Android.

Secondly, iPad apps are optimized for the iPad and function more seamlessly whereas apps on the Android tablet crashed and displayed error messages frequently. Additionally, there is more of a selection of apps for Speech-Language Pathology on the iPad (iOS) platform.

Finally, the iPad in general appeared to be more motivating to her students. Subjective information as well as objective data found in this study both suggest iPads are a better tablet for the field of Speech-Language Pathology.

<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>

At the conclusion of the tablet pilot study, participants were sent another survey designed to gather information about the tablets overall. Toward the end of the trial, several participants that had been assigned Android tablets opted out of the trial due to their tablets being inconvenient instead of helpful. Additionally, after nearly a year, the Android tablets only held their battery charge for half a school day before needing to be plugged in and recharged. Because of the difficulties with the Androids, this final survey only gathered data for iPads. The responses suggest iPads are effective tools for SLPs in both the treatment and case management of speech and language disorders. See the chart below for a breakdown of data. Participants were asked to rate the iPad on a scale of 1 (a lot less effective than traditional therapy tools) to 10 (a lot more effective than traditional therapy tools).

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/graph_4.png"" alt=""iPad effectiveness - graph 1"" width=""662"" height=""642"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-714"" />

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/graph_5.png"" alt=""iPad effectiveness - graph 2"" width=""662"" height=""642"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-715"" />

An additional benefit of iPads, explored after the trial, was the ability to bill Medicaid at the treatment table either during the session or immediately following it. The SHARS Medicaid billing website quickly loads on the iPad and its formatting allows it to be clearly viewed on the tablet platform. It takes only a minute or two to input the session data, especially when using a Bluetooth keyboard. iPads would aid SLPs in efficiently billing Medicaid in a timely manner.

Data reported above decisively substantiates that tablets are an effective tool for Speech-Language Pathologists. 

Moreover, according to both objective and subjective data, iPads clearly outperformed Android tablets in all three areas: 

1. Being an effective therapy tool
2. Being an effective motivational tool
3. Being an effective case management tool

<font color=""red""><em><strong>Note:</strong> Little Bee Speech had no contact with this school district before or during the study. Articulation Station Pro was purchased directly by the district for the study. The district did not receive any kind of compensation or promotional codes for apps during the study.</em></font>


<p style=""text-align: center;"">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

If you’ve been on the fence about integrating tablet technology into your therapy routine, have wondered which tablet to invest in, or have speculated if mobile applications are as effective as traditional therapy materials, we hope the results from this district's study are insightful to you.

We are grateful to school districts like this one that are willing to share their research with all of us. We are thrilled that Articulation Station Pro (along with the other great apps mentioned) was included in the study, and we agree that speech and language applications on mobile devices are helping us be more efficient and productive with our therapy time.

The district who conducted this study was also kind enough to share some of the feedback from their SLPs specifically about using Articulation Station Pro to collect data for their study. We enjoyed reading this feedback and we're happy to share it with you...

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""Student asked to play 'my game again'. [I like] not fumbling through pictures when changing sounds. Achieve approximately 40 attempts within one minute.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""Quicker than cards and more engaging!""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


<em>""Motivated by playing the game, enjoyed using the device as it was quicker and more efficient than traditional methods. Data tracking was faster, and could get more repetitions per minute.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""I have the student(s) drill their sound at the word or sentence level while playing a traditional game such as Jenga. The constant auditory and visual feedback from the check button and the X button are a great way to provide instant feedback, and I even use that feature during conversation to provide quick feedback at the conversational level.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""Used in artic group to drill sounds. Easily switches sounds for students when you set up a group session.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""I used this APP to target specific sounds as well as language skills in mixed articulation and language groups! Students working on the sound would drill the word and students working on language skills would describe the picture. Love this APP!""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""Love this app to work on artic and keep track of the data.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""Have used at the word and phrase level. Students enjoy recording their productions. Good for drill activity and feedback""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


<em>""Love using the Phonological Processes section! Students are engaged with the matching game. Excellent way to get them to self-monitor using the red/yellow/green buttons.. first with my feedback, then moving to them rating themselves.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""For kids who have very limited language I go through the picture flash cards and have them identify the object in the picture. For the students who have a little more language I have them say a phrase or sentence about the picture. If they have enough language I have them play the matching game and identify something a mismatching pair have in common.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""A new way besides ""go fish"" to get a lot of targets in- the matching game!""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""It has all the normal aspects of an articulation app, but my students are especially enjoying the matching game on the word level and the rotating buttons on the phrase and sentence level. The recording option is always a great one for self-monitoring so I'm glad this app has that too.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""During STAAR testing I was not allowed back in my room so I traveled from place to place with my iPad. This app allowed me to carry everything with me, quickly switch back and forth between games, and record the data to be sent through email and retrieved later.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""My kids loved the change of setting and the new app!""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""Use for student's target sounds. I like how it reads the word, phrase, or sentence when you touch it. The student is able to navigate it well independently.""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""Used to obtain data on articulation goals for each student in the group. Able to program specific phonemes and /vocalic /r/ types for each student. Each student was recorded and was able to evaluate their accuracy +- or approximation (Close) and recorded data. Loved it!""</em>

<p style=""text-align:"">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<em>""I use it with my articulation students working on specific sounds at the word and phrase level. I love how it keeps the data for me and I can refer very quickly to the last session completed.""</em>

¡Articulation Station Español!,articulation-station-espanol,Little Bee,2016-09-15,App Store,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_14.jpg,"We are so excited to announce that our most popular app, Articulation Station is now available in Spanish! It's called <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/articulation_station_spanish.php"" target=""_blank"">""Articulation Station Español""</a>.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_14.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-975"" />

After receiving so many requests for a Spanish version of Articulation Station from bilingual Speech Language Pathologists all around the country we decided it was time to make it happen. 

We teamed up with 3 very passionate bilingual speech-language pathologists, an exceptionally brilliant trilingual linguist and a very talented voice actress to bring you the best Spanish articulation app available!

Articulation Station Español was created so that parents, teachers and speech-Language pathologists would have a fun and useful tool to teach Spanish speaking children and adults how to speak more clearly. 

Articulation Station Español has 6 engaging activities for practicing the sounds at the word, phrase and sentence levels. 

<strong>Quick Tips</strong>

We have also included “Quick Tips” for how to teach the sounds in each sound program. The Quick Tips help a parent, teacher or speech-language pathologist elicit the correct production of the target sound before the child begins to practice the sound in words, phrases and sentences.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_01-1.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002"" />

<strong>Word Level Activities</strong>

We have two activities for practicing the sound at the word level, “flashcards” and “matching.” The flashcards help familiarize a child with the target words. 

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_05.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-980"" />

The matching game is a fun way to keep children and adults engaged in the activity as they continue to practice their sounds at the word level.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_06.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-981"" />

Once the child has mastered the word level you can turn the articles on in the settings. How cool is that? Now the child can practice two word phrases, the target word plus the article.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_07.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-982"" />

Each target word in the program was chosen very carefully. Regional differences and articulation targets were considered. In the end articulation targets were prioritized over regional vocabulary differences allowing us to provide a consistent number of target words in each sound program. When possible, words were chosen that are common among dialects. 

To accommodate for regional preferences <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/articulation_station_pro_spanish.php"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Pro Español</a> allows you to add your own words using the custom image feature and remove words or edit word lists using the custom list feature. Watch our <a href=""https://youtu.be/qpnXnhpkhFc"" target=""_blank"">video tutorials</a> to learn more about these features.


<strong>Phrase Level Activities</strong>

There are two activities for practicing target sounds at the phrase level: Rotating Phrases and Unique Phrases. 

The “Rotating Phrases” are three word phrases with a “target word” and a “modifier word.” The target word has the sound we’re practicing in the targeted sound position and the article associated with that word. The modifier word is the word that follows the target word and adds to the meaning of the noun. Both the target words and the modifier words have spin buttons associated with them allowing you to spin one or the other producing hundreds of word combinations.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_08.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-985"" />

Each unique phrase has between three to five words in the phrase. This makes them the perfect next step following rotating phrases. Additionally, they are generally descriptive phrases which allows you to work on language goals, such as describing things, at the same time.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_09.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-986"" />

<strong>Sentence Level Activities</strong>

There are two activities for practicing target sounds at the sentence level: Rotating Sentences and Unique Sentences.

In “Rotating Sentences,” the sentence stays the same and only the target word changes. Having the sentence stay the same allows the child/adult to memorize the sentence and practice it with greater fluency. For example:

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_10.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-987"" />

The target word in this example is “piñata”. Each rotating sentence also has at least 2 additional words with the target sound in it to maximize practice opportunities. Notice “cumpleaños and niño” in the above example. In addition these sentences have picture prompts to help beginner readers retell the sentence. Besides all that, IT’S FUN! The kids love pushing the spin button in this activity to see what word card comes up next.

Unique sentences are a great opportunity for a child/adult to practice the target sound in more words. Each unique sentence has an average 3 words with the target sound in it. For example:

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp_eng_13.jpg"" alt=""Articulation Station Español App by Little Bee Speech"" width=""690"" height=""499"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-988"" />

In this sentence “cabaña” is the target word but the medial ñ sound can also be practiced on “año” and “montaña.” Each unique sentence is different and fun!

<strong>Additional Features</strong>

Articulation Station Español also allows you to practice vowels and diphthongs, target phonological processes, work on multiple sounds at one time, add your own custom images, create your own custom lists and work in group sessions.

We've LOVED hearing from SLPs that have shared their thoughts on this app with us. Here are a few of them:


<blockquote>“I love that the app takes students from word level to sentence level. It’s by far the best Spanish articulation app I have used--thorough and engaging!”</blockquote>



<blockquote>“I have used the English version of Articulation Station for several years now and found it to be, hands-down, the best articulation app. Spanish-speaking children make up at least half of my pediatric caseload and I have long yearned for a user-friendly interface in Spanish. Now it's here! Articulation Station Pro Español! It has everything I want in a Spanish articulation app and I highly recommend it to anyone working with Spanish-speaking clients.”</blockquote>



<blockquote>“I work as a home health SLP and the majority of my patients are Spanish-speaking. I am more than in love with this app!”</blockquote>



 We really enjoyed developing this app and working with so many talented people to make it happen. We hope that you will enjoy working with Articulation Station Español in helping your Spanish speaking kiddos with their articulation.

With the release of iOS 10 Apple added a bunch of fun new features to iMessage, including effects, apps, and stickers that you can send to your friends. Stickers are used when chatting in the Messages app and are a super fun way of adding spice and emotion to your chats. 

We've just released our first Stickers app for iOS 10 and we're over the moon excited about it! The app is called ""Beemojis"", which as you probably noticed is a mashup of the words ""bee"" and ""emojis"".

You can use these stickers just like emojis and you can also ""stick"" them on top of messages and pictures that were shared within a chat window. They are so fun to use and we're excited to have our cute little bees available for everyone to enjoy!

Auto Marking Phonological Processes and Adding Norms - Update 2.5 is here!,auto-marking-phonological-processes-and-adding-norms-update-2-5-is-here,Little Bee,2017-02-02,App Store,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ATC.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/header-2.png"" alt="""" width=""693"" height=""732"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1264"" />
Articulation Test Center update 2.5 is finally available with 3 new exciting features that will save you time, give you the results you want and safeguard your data. 

Here are the details: 

<strong>1. Articulation Test Center now marks phonological processes automatically
2. Add your own norms into the app
3. Backup your data and keep it safe</strong>

To take advantage of these new features all you have to do is update your app to the latest version for free. If you don't already own this app you can download it on the App Store free and try it before purchasing the Pro version. It's currently only available for iPad.

<strong>Auto Marking Phonological Processes</strong>

Now Phonological Processes can be marked automatically when an applicable substitution or omission is made. Hooray for time savers!

For example, if a child says “wabbit” for “rabbit,” and you mark the substitution by dragging the ‘w’ sound tile and dropping it on top of the ‘r’ sound tile at the top, the substitution error will be automatically marked as “gliding.” How cool is that?!

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ipad1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""524"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1267"" />
<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/auto_marking.png"" alt="""" width=""689"" height=""312"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1266"" /> 

Here's a quick little video showing how phonological processes are marked automatically in Articulation Test Center:

<iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eh5NfknejmA?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<strong>The following phonological processes are marked AUTOMATICALLY when this feature is turned on:</strong> 

• Backing
• Fronting
• Stopping (fricatives)
• Stopping (affricates)
• Gliding
• Vowelization
• Labialization
• Denasalization
• Voicing
• Devoicing
• Initial Consonant Deletion
• Final Consonant Deletion
• Cluster Reduction
• Interdental Lisp (marked as a distortion)

<strong>The following processes will NOT be marked automatically and will continue to require the expertise of the test administrator to mark when the process applies:</strong>

• Deaffrication
• Affrication
• Alveolarization
• Depalitalization
• Assimilation
• Coalescence
• Reduplication
• Weak Syllable Deletion
• Epenthesis

Auto marking phonological processes is on by default. If you do not wish to have phonological processes marked automatically you can turn this feature off in the app Settings. 

<em>We always recommended that you use your professional judgement to ensure the automatically marked processes apply. If an auto-marked process does not apply you can simply swipe the process off of the substitution tile and replace it with the applicable process.</em>

<strong>Adding Your Own Norms</strong>

Articulation Test Center now has the flexible option of changing the speech sound norms that the test results are based on.

You may have a set of research based norms that you are either required to use or that you prefer to use. Now you can add and edit norms within Articulation Test Center based on your professional preferences and research.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ipad2.png"" alt="""" width=""692"" height=""536"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1268"" />

When you add or edit norms you will need to give the new norms a name, add your name as the contributor, and cite the research you are referencing before your norms can be saved and applied to the test results.

The name of the norms being used, contributor’s name and the research cited will be included in the results and in the final report.

For example if your therapy setting requires that you use the Iowa-Nebraska Articulation Norms no problem. Simply open the norms in Articulation Test Center, tap “add new” and enter the ages of acquisition for each phoneme. Then save your norms. 

Check out this quick video on how norms work in Articulation Test Center:

<iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_auYrSbYQg?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When you administer a test you can choose which norms you want the test results to be based on, the Articulation Test Center (Default) norms or the new norms you have added. You may add as many norm sets as you’d like. 

You can also change the norms for previous tests given by tapping on the “change” button located next to the name of the Norms the test results are based on.

<strong>Data Backup and Restore</strong>

Keep your data safe! Articulation Test Center now allows you to backup your saved scores, recordings, notes & student profiles so they are safe and secure. There are 2 options for backing up your data:

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ipad4.png"" alt="""" width=""692"" height=""536"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1270"" />

<strong>1. Backup to your iPad</strong> 
Each week your data is backed up automatically to your iPad. There will be a total of 3 backups that are kept on the device. While it's good to have your data backed up, it's still not completely safe on your device. Devices can get lost or stolen. If that happens to you, your data is lost. To avoid this you will need to copy the backed up data file from your iPad to your computer. There is a tutorial video in the app showing how to do this.

<strong>2. Backup to iCloud</strong>
This is the best option for backing up your data safely and securely and it's the option we recommend. Your data gets backed up to the cloud. This means if your iPad is lost or stolen you can easily restore the data to your new iPad from iCloud. It's a safe, worry-free solution that's easy to use. If you do it now, there may come a time when you will thank yourself later!

To backup your data to iCloud open the app, and from the home screen tap Scores > Backup/Restore > iCloud.

We're excited to finally share these exciting new features with you. We know you’re going to enjoy using them so be sure and update your app right away to version 2.5.  

If you don’t own Articulation Test Center yet you can try these new features and all the other great features Articulation Test Center has to offer for free by downloading Articulation Test Center on the App Store.

<strong>When the update goes through, can we go back and edit screenings/tests to utilize the phonological feature?</strong>
The auto marking feature only works at the time the substitution is made. So previous tests that already have the substitutions marked will not be marked automatically with the associated processes unless the test administrator edits the results and marks the substitutions or omissions again.

<strong>Are you able to mark multiple errors on the Articulation Test Center (e.g. cluster reduction and substitution? skate—&gt;tate)</strong>
In the example you provided, yes. For example, when the s is deleted it will be auto-marked as cluster reduction. When the /k/ is substituted with a /t/ it will be auto-marked as fronting.

<strong>Please share exactly which phonetic keyboard you have downloaded. Thanks.</strong>
The name of the phonetic keyboard I used in the presentation is called, “Phonetic Keyboards” but you can search the App Store for ""phonetic keyboard"" and find the keyboard app that you like best.

<strong>Do you have to press the red record button for each stimulus card separately or can you tap it once at the beginning to record all?</strong>
Yes, currently you have to press the red record button each time. We plan to update this in a future update so you will only have to press it once and it will record the entire test and then save each recording under the corresponding stimulus word.

<strong>Does the microphone pick up the background noise in the speech sample?</strong>
If the background noise (environmental sounds) are on, they will be recorded by the microphone. If you do not want the background noise in your audio recording simply turn off the environmental sounds by tapping the audio button in the upper right hand corner of the speech scene.

<strong>How much space does this take up on an iPad?</strong>
The download size of the app is 175 MB. As you save test data and make audio recordings in the app this size will increase. We have worked to optimize the size of the audio recording so that they take up the least amount of space as possible. 

<strong>What is the general amount of space that this app uses when all features are used for let's say 20 students?</strong>
A rough estimate of space taken up by Articulation Test Center for 20 kids tested would be about 350 MB.
We have put a lot of work into optimizing the audio files to keep the app size down. Of course this number will fluctuate depending on how long your speech sample recordings are and how many audio recordings you take and save. It also depends on how many data backups you have saved to your device. To keep the size down be sure to manage your data backups by tapping on “data backup” from the scores screen. Then delete any unnecessary data backups that are being saved to your device by swiping left on them. The app will automatically update to your device once a week. It only keeps the last two updates. Any updates made manually will have to be deleted by the user when they are no longer needed.

<strong>Is the distortions feature available now? If so, how do you locate it?</strong>
The distortions feature is available now. To access the distortions open the substitutions menu (tap the down arrow to the right of the word tiles on the top of the flashcard) then tap on the button for distortions located in the bottom right corner of the substitutions menu.

<strong>If you are doing an artic assessment as part of a larger assessment, can you 'cut n paste' the report into other reports?</strong>
You can copy and paste anything from the email but unfortunately the formatting will sometimes be lost. We are working on improving the way reports can be shared and edited and it will be included in a future update.

<strong>Would this be a stand alone test or would you follow up with a standardized test?</strong>
That depends on what your therapy setting requires. If standardized tests are not required you can use it as a stand alone test. If your therapy setting requires a standardized test you can use this as a supplemental assessment in conjunction with standardized tests. Or you can use it as an informal assessment to monitor progress.

<strong>As an informal assessment, can we still use it to qualify a student with a speech-language impairment, articulation? How would you recommend using it along with the GFTA-3 or other formal assessments?</strong>
That depends on the qualification requirements of your therapy setting. Most therapy settings require two forms of assessment for qualification. One of which can usually be an informal assessment.
If only a standardized test is required I would still administer this test as a supplemental measure. Two measures are always better than one.

A few of the benefits of administering Articulation Test Center in addition to the GFTA-3 are:

• Saved recordings of each word- allow you to make sure test results are accurate, and can be easily accessed to monitor progress.
• Auto-marked phonological processes save you so much time.
• Detailed reports that breakdown sound substitutions/ omissions, phonological processes/ distortions as well as the percentage of occurrence among the errors.
• Speech scenes that make acquiring speech and language samples easy and fun.
• Intelligibility tracker that makes acquiring an accurate intelligibility rating easy.
• Full written report, written so parents can understand. This will save you so much time.
• It’s quicker to administer because kids are more engaged and you can record productions and score them later.
• The ability to add Speech Sound Norms that are based on my geographic location or are recommended by my therapy setting for qualification.
• The ability to quickly and easily email reports to parents and or other professionals working with a client.

<strong>Does the app come pre-loaded with multiple articulation norms or just the Articulation Center Norms?</strong>
It only comes with the Articulation Test Center (default) norms. You will need to add any additional norms that you want to use.

<strong>How long does the typical student take to administer the full test?</strong>
If the student's productions are recorded and then scored later it's typically 5 minutes or less (without a speech sample).

<strong>Will Articulation Test Center ever be standardized?</strong>
We have no plans to standardize the test at this time.

<strong>Does Test Center come in English and Spanish too?</strong>
Articulation Test Center is only in English.

<strong>Will you be making a Spanish version of Test Center Pro?</strong>
We have no plans at this time to make a Spanish version of Articulation Test Center.

<strong>When you change your norms, does it change it in the report?</strong>
Yes, the results in the report will be based on the norms you have selected.

<strong>What research are the original norms based on in the Articulation Test Center?</strong>
All research and norms can be found on the <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/articulation_test_center_pro.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Little Bee Speech website</a>.

<h2>Articulation Station Questions</h2>

<strong>Any chance of including vowels in future updates? Or maybe a completely brand new app :D</strong>
Adding vowels is something we are considering but no definite decisions have been made.

<strong>If you already have Articulation Station Pro are future updates automatic or do you have to repurchase?</strong>
Currently, all updates are free.

<strong>Do you have to press the red record button for each stimulus card separately or can you tap it once at the beginning to record all?</strong>
In Articulation Station you can tap the red record button once to record all speech productions on each word.

<strong>How did you get to the 3 word phrases?</strong>
To access 3 word phrases, select ""phrases"", then ""unique phrases"".

<strong>Will there ever be a way to collect data on the target words in sentences that aren’t bolded? Just curious. I still collect that data but we always debrief at the end and go over what the student misses.</strong>
We don’t currently have any plans to do that, but that is a good suggestion, we will consider it.

<strong>Where do you go to add a custom word list again?</strong>
Select the sound program, select words, phrases or sentences, select your activity, and as soon as you select your sound position, an icon will appear below the “begin” button called “Words/ Lists.” When you tap on “Words/ Lists” your word list will be available for you to modify and save.

For more details on Custom Word Lists you can watch the following video tutorial:

<iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/58134782"" width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<strong>Can you work on more than one sound at a time with an artic kid, such as a kid working on 'th' and ‘r’?</strong>
Yes! To target multiple sounds at once tap the “Multiple Sounds” button at the bottom of the home screen. Then select the sounds, and positions you want to target.

<strong>How did you group pics by food and drinks?</strong>
I opened “Multiple Sounds” and then selected all the sounds and sound positions, then I tapped on the “Words/ Lists” button. I deselected all the words, then I quickly scanned the word lists selecting all the food words. Then I saved my list and named it “Food.” Next time I want to access this list all I have to do is open “Multiple Sounds” and tap on the “Words/ Lists” to access my custom word list with my “Food” list on it.

<strong>Where are Phonological Processes on Articulation Station located?</strong>
Phonological processes are only available in Articulation Station Pro. If you do not own Pro you can upgrade to Pro from within the free version of the app and get a special discounted price based on how many in app purchases you have previously purchased. If you own Pro, simply tap on the red “Phonological Processes” button in the bottom right corner of the home screen.

<strong>Can you target the phonological process at the phrase/sentence level?</strong>
Currently you can only target phonological processes at the word level.

<strong>Is all of this based on “independently”? Is there a way to mark if a model was given?</strong>
The yellow “approximation” button is intended to be used as a “catch all.” Meaning, if a child’s speech production is close but not quite right, mark it as an approximation. If a child requires prompting to produce the sound correctly, mark it with the yellow “approximation” symbol to indicate they are getting close but they can’t quite produce the sound independently. You may also make a note in the notes section of the results for which words required prompting.

<strong>How do you add photos?</strong>
The custom image feature is only available to Pro users. To upgrade to Pro tap on the Store button in the upper right corner of the home screen.
If you are a Pro user, tap on the “Custom Images” button in the lower left corner of the Home Screen. Then tap “add,” then “add image”. Then select a photo or take a photo. Then give your image a name, type a phrase and a sentence then save your image to the sound program you would like the image saved to.
For more details on adding custom images watch the following video tutorial: 

<iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/56665206"" width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<strong>Are there separate lists for Vocalic R sounds?</strong>
Yes. To access all the vocalic Rs open the r program, select words, phrases, sentences or stories. Then select your activity. Then when you choose your sound position (initial, medial, final, or blends), more options will be revealed. For example if you choose r- initial you will then be given the choice to practice the prevocalic r or initial ‘air,’ ‘ar,’ ‘ear,’ ‘ire,’ ‘or’ or ‘er.’

<h2>General Questions</h2>

<strong>Do you primarily work with articulation/phonology clients? Do you see them only at your home therapy office and how often?</strong>
I have been working exclusively on developing apps for the last 4 1/2 years. Prior to that I saw clients in my private practice. I saw mostly school age clients focusing on articulation/phonology as well as language skills. I saw clients once a week.

<strong>Any more apps in mind?</strong>
Yes, we have another AMAZING app underway! I can’t wait to share it with you. We don’t project it will be done until later this year. Be sure to sign up for our email list, or follow us on social media so you can be the first to know when it is released. :)

<strong>Any Little Bee Speech apps targeting language coming our way?</strong>
Yes! They’re in the works.

<strong>Any thoughts on having seasonal backgrounds in the future?</strong>
We have considered it, but it isn’t currently on our list of priorities.

<strong>Any plans for Android?</strong>
No plans at the moment. If we do decide to develop for Android we will announce it on our FB page.

<strong>Does the Reflector app project on a SmartBoard also?</strong>
It might be a possibility. <a href=""http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Reflector</a> is an app that you can download to your computer. It wirelessly connects with your iPad so that the iPad screen can be mirrored on your computer. If your computer can connect o the Smartboard then it seems Reflector should work great. I did a little searching and found an article that might be helpful with this. You can read it <a href=""http://www.appeducation.com/2012/06/10/reflection-app-mirror-you-ipad-in-the-classroom/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here.</a> 

<strong>Any idea if you can use your apps in online therapy? I work part time for Presence Learning and would LOVE to have Articulation Station on that therapy platform.</strong>
If Presence Learning has an option to share your computer screen with the client then you should be able to use apps like <a href=""http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Reflector</a> to mirror your iPad screen on your computer for therapy.","<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/headers/slp_summit.png"" alt=""SLP Summit follow up"" width=""690"" height=""300"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-64"" />

Articulation Station Classic Homework Referral Sheet  (PDF Download),articulation-station-homework-suggestion-sheet-pdf,Little Bee,2017-05-22,Articulation,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/worksheet1.jpg,"One of the great things about Articulation Station Classic is that SLPs can refer the app to parents for their kids to work on their sounds at home using the app. Parents can download only the sounds that their child needs to practice at home. This helps bridge the gap between practice in the therapy room and what is practiced at home which can help increase the child's speech progress.

To make the process of referring Articulation Station Classic to parents easier we have put together this <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/resources/pdf/as_homework_sheet.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">homework referral sheet</a>. SLPs can mark what sounds the parent should download and work on, and which activities their child can practice at home within the app. Prices are also listed for all the sounds for easy reference.

There are 3 spaces to write in the sounds you would like the child to practice at home and the r, l and s sounds have all of their respective sounds listed that you can choose from as well.

Here is an example of what this sheet might look like if the SLP wanted to the parents to download Articulation Station Classic and practice (at home) the initial k sound at the word level using flashcards.

"How to Target Speech, Language and Literacy Goals with Little Stories Pro (SLP Summit - January 2018)",slp-summit-follow-up-january-2018,Little Bee,2018-01-25,Literacy,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/summit_2018v2.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lsp-1.png"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""165"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1424"" />

It was so much fun to share Little Stories Pro with all of you at the 2018 <a href=""https://slpsummit.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">SLP Summit</a> in January. I hope you are as excited about this app as I am! It is the only tool I am aware of that targets speech, language and literacy objectives so thoroughly all in one place.

<strong>I can’t find the app in the App Store? Is Little Stories Pro only available for iPad, or is it available for the iPhone also?</strong>
Little Stories Pro is available for iPads running iOS 9 and later. It is not available on iPhone (yet) so if you search the app on your iPhone it will not pull up. Search ""Little Stories Pro"" on your iPad and you'll easily find it. If you still don’t see it search ""Little Bee Speech Apps"".  You can also <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-stories-pro/id1228283813?mt=8"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">click here to view Little Stories Pro in the U.S. App Store</a>.

<strong>If I have Articulation Station, will I be able to get Little Stories Pro?  I have an old iPad but have Articulation Station Pro.</strong>
Little Stories Pro requires a newer operating system than Articulation Station Pro currently does. Your iPad must be running iOS 11 or newer.

<strong>I’m not understanding how to get this app for my iPad if you do not go to the App Store.</strong>
The only way to get Little Stories Pro is to download it through the Apple App Store. Click <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-stories-pro/id1228283813?mt=8"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> for a direct link to the App Store.

<strong>Are these only available on Apple products? Is Little Stories Pro available for Android?</strong>
Little Stories Pro is only available for the iPad running iOS 9 and later.

O<strong>ur district did a bulk buy of your other apps.  Is this one available via a bulk discount as well?</strong>
Little Stories Pro is available in Apple’s Volume Purchase Program for education. Here is a direct link to the app in the <a href=""https://volume.itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-stories-pro/id1228283813?mt=8&term=little%20stories%20Pro&ign-mpt=uo%3D4"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Volume Purchase Education Store.</a>

<strong>Is there a trial version of this app? Looks awesome!</strong>
We do not currently have a trial version of Little Stories Pro but we are working on one and we hope to release is within the next couple of months!

<strong>Are there 2 separate apps: Little Stories for Speech and Little Stories Pro?</strong>
No. We currently only have one version of this app, Little Stories Pro.

<strong>Might you adapt materials for PC use? (This would be more convenient for teletherapy.) If you did adapt these for PC, I would gratefully share it in all of my teletherapy (materials) groups!</strong>
We do not have any plans to adapt this app for PC use at this time but if that changes we will announce it on our Facebook page first! 

<strong>Can you go over reading level text again?</strong>
The stories in Little Stories Pro are leveled according to their narrative complexity, vocabulary difficulty, and age appropriateness.

Here are the specific levels: 

Level A: ages 6.5-7.5 (mid first grade to second grade)
Level B: ages 7-8.5 (second grade)
Level C: ages 8-9.5 (third to fourth grade)

Within these categories the stories are sorted according to their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch–Kincaid_readability_tests"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Flesch-Kincaid</a> scores. This measure predicts the readability of a text by using the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word.

<strong>Do your reading and fluency levels correlate with a reading program called Fountas & Pinnell?  Our district uses this to assess our students reading levels and target where they should be by grade level (not age level)</strong>.
Our reading levels do not correlate with Fountas & Pinnell but we did use Fountas & Pinnel type factors when we leveled our stories such as narrative complexity and age appropriateness.

Our reading system uses BOTH qualitative and quantitative measurements. The qualitative measures were determined based on narrative complexity, vocabulary difficulty, and age appropriateness. The quantitative comes through the calculations we got through Flesch-Kincaid. We found that combining both qualitative with quantitative helped to balance out the limitations of both approaches.

<strong>Is there a way to correlate TRC/DIBELS levels to the reading levels in the app?</strong>
Not at this time.

<strong>What is the highest age/ grade level these stories are appropriate for?</strong>
The stories were written for grades K-4 but we have found that upper elementary students that are struggling with reading fluency, comprehension and/or speech production can benefit from reading these stories as well. Enlarging the text field to exclude the illustration is one way to make the stories more age appropriate.

<strong>Are there any stories appropriate for older elementary students?</strong>
There are some stories in the app that older elementary students will find particularly interesting. Here are a few of my favorites for older elementary kids.

- Pirate Treasure (Fixing the pirates speech errors is a great grammar lesson.)
- Blair’s Dare (Memorizing this funny poem can be a fun challenge.)
- Theseus and the Labyrinth (A classic tale from Greek Mythology in a simpler format.)

There are also several stories written in the 2nd person point of view. A discussion on how to identify different points of view and write in different points of view would also be a great learning activity.

We also offer a more in depth look at our stories in the <em>Closer Look</em> section. Students can learn a lot about narrative techniques, narrative structures and narrative genres by identifying them in these short stories. 

<strong>How many different phoneme targets are there? Does it include earlier developing phonemes or just the later developing ones?</strong>
There are 41 different phonemic targets. The targets include:
/l/ initial
/l/ medial
/l/ final
/l/ mixed positions
/sl/ blend
/bl/ blend
/fl/ blend
/gl/ blend
/kl/ blend
/pl/ blend
/r/ initial
air- mixed positions
/ar/ mixed positions
ear mixed positions
ire mixed positions
/or/ mixed positions
er mixed positions
rl mixed positions
r mixed positions
/br/ blend
/dr/ blend
/fr/ blend
/gr/ blend
/kr/ blend
/tr/ blend
/pr/ blend
/s/ initial
/s/ medial
/s/ final
/s/ mixed positions
/st/ blend
/sk/ blend
/sp/ blend
/sw/ blend
/sm/ blend
/sn/ blend
th voiced & voiceless initial
th voiced medial
th voiceless medial
th voiceless final
th voiced & voiceless final
th voiced & voiceless mixed positions

<strong>In the future, would there be a chance of adding earlier developing phonemes? Will you be adding stories for additional phonemes?</strong>
Yes. We hope to be able to add more stories that target more phonemes.

<strong>Are there vowel combinations/dipthongs targeted in the stories?</strong>
Only the vocalic Rs are targeted.

<strong>Can you print out flashcards?</strong>
You cannot print out the flashcards but the words in error are listed and can be sent home in an email or printed out.

<strong>Can you print the story to send home to parents?</strong>
Yes. You can print or email student results (from the data screen) and the story will be included for the student to practice at home.

<strong>Do you mark errors on the iPad while the student is reading?</strong>
Errors are marked after the student has finished reading, while you listen to the recording. This can be done with the child present or alone when you have time.

<strong>When and where are you tracking errors?</strong>
To track reading, vocabulary and speech errors select the reading fluency test by tapping on the stop watch icon in the lower left corner of the story text field. Have the student read the story aloud. Then listen to the recording and mark the errors.

<strong>Do you mark every word that is in error or is one counted wrong just once (like mammoth)?</strong>
Every time a word is read incorrectly it is marked as a reading error. Every time a word is said incorrectly it is marked as a speech error. Vocabulary errors are only marked once.

<strong>Could you clarify-What does the APP track?</strong>
When a reading fluency test is initiated the app records the child reading and tracks the time it takes the child to read the 100 word story. It is up to the reading helper and/or reader to mark the errors. After the student’s reading sample has been scored the app automatically calculates the words correct per minute based on the time it took the child to read the 100 word story minus the number of reading errors. Speech and vocabulary errors can also be scored in the reading fluency test.

In the comprehension activities Story retell can be scored for story structure and expressive language. When a child completes the sequencing activity and comprehension questions scores can be saved for those as well.

<strong>Are the reading fluency norms listed in the app?</strong>
The reading fluency norms are not listed in the app at this time but we do plan to include them in a future update.

<strong>Do you delete the student’s reading sample as you go?  Can it be zipped to save space?</strong>
Reading samples can only be deleted if the entire session is deleted. To delete a session swipe left on the session summary in the scores screen.

<strong>Does the sequencing have pictures to sequence for younger students or just the sentences?</strong>
The sequencing does not have pictures. We created the sequencing activity to not only help the students learn to put the events of the story in the correct order but to also teach story structure by teaching them word prompts for the different parts of the story. For example, a good way to introduce a story is to use words like, “Once there was…” and a good way to introduce the problem would be to use a word like, “but…”

A great extension activity would be to have the child draw the scenes of the story and write their own sentence for each scene using the word prompts, “Once there was… but… so… finally…now…” They could put them in order to create a story. You could even print the coloring page for the story to use as a cover image.

<strong>Can you graph the comprehension info?</strong>
For now, Words Correct Per Minute, and Speech, Reading, and Vocabulary errors are the only results that are graphed.

<strong>I have your Articulation Pro.  Is there a way to delete student names after they are no longer receiving services?</strong>
To delete a student’s name swipe to the left on their name and a red delete button will appear.

<strong>Can you toggle between students to take data when working with groups?</strong>
No. You can’t work with one student, pause where they are, work with another student and then return to the first student’s data in the same way that you can in Articulation Station.

<strong>Can I use Little Stories Pro for group therapy?</strong>
Yes, with adaptations. You can do a reading fluency test with one student, save your results and then begin a new reading fluency test with another student immediately following the first student.

You can also complete any of the comprehension activities with one student, save your results and then begin a new comprehension activity with another student immediately following the first.

If you are working in a group I would recommend printing out the coloring page of the story you are working on for each student. You can do pre-reading activities with all the student’s together. You can read the story to the students, then while the students color their picture or make written predictions you can have the student’s read to you one at a time. After they have each read the story they can each take a turn completing the comprehension activities. It’s likely that each student won’t have the same goals so you can pick and choose the activities that meet each student’s individual objectives. Then you could do the story talk questions as a group at the end as a post reading activity.

<strong>How did you access the coloring pages? I have the app but I can’t find them.</strong>
To access the coloring pages you have to go back to the story selection screen and close the sorting options by tapping on the round sorting button in the lower right corner of the screen. Then you will see the blue coloring icon appear next to the data button. Selecting the blue coloring icon will open up the coloring pages. In a future update of the app the coloring pages button will be visible on the screen at all times.

<strong>Can it be used on a Smartboard or Elmo?</strong>
Yes, if you can hook your iPad up to your Smartboard it will work. Of course you still have to interact with the app on the iPad.

<strong>How much data does it take up?</strong>
195 MB - plus any data and audio recording that you save within the app. We have taken measures to shrink the sizes of all the audio files created with the app to ensure the app takes up the least amount of space possible on your device.

<strong>Can we get  a copy of all slides you presented. Some very good info. I would like to share this with EL and Reading specialists.</strong>
Yes. Click <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/slpsummit/slides_heidi_hanks_jan2018.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> to download the slides.We have also made the slides available on the SLP Summit page when you log in. 

<strong>Is the screen sharing tool you use free?</strong>
For this presentation I connected my iPad directly in the computer using the usb cord and used <a href=""https://support.apple.com/quicktime"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Quicktime Player</a> to mirror the iPad screen onto the computer.

<strong>Can you target initial, medial, and final positions at the same time in Articulation Station?</strong>
Yes, you can target any combination of sound positions you wish. You can choose the sound position/s before you begin the activity and/or you can add in sound positions once you are in the activity (unless you are doing a matching game in which case the sound positions have to be chosen before you begin the activity).

<strong>How did you get to the rotating phrases (spinners) in the app when you showed us the example for the goal about describing?</strong>
To access rotating phrases select the sound program you want to target, select phrases, choose rotating,  select the sound position and then tap begin. If you want to modify the “lead words” or “target words” that will be rotated through the activity tap on the custom list icon in the bottom right corner of the screen before you begin the activity.

In the presentation, I chose the rotating phrase activity, then tapped on the custom list icon, selected lead words, and then tapped on “+ add word.” I added the following questions for targeting describing skills in therapy. Then I deselected all of the lead words except for the questions I added.

“What does it look like?”
“What does it feel like?”
“What does it smell like?”
“What does it sound like?”
“What does it taste like?”

<strong>Any suggestions for keeping track of which descriptions the child missed? Some of my kids are great at “looks like,” but struggle with the more abstract descriptions. Do you just keep that information on the side?</strong>
There are lots of different ways you can track which descriptions the child is struggling with:

Record their responses, then listen to them later and make notes in the notes section (in the results) about which ones they struggled with.

Take notes during the session and add the notes to the results after the session is complete.
Create a custom list for a specific task like, “What does it feel like?” and then score their responses. The results will display scores for the specific custom list, in this example you would see scores for, “What does it feel like?”

<strong>Can you explain how to make the custom lists again? Or are there tutorials on the app for creating custom lists?</strong>
You can access a video tutorial for creating custom lists from within the app. To find the tutorials select  the “i” (information button) found on the bottom of the home screen next to the scores button. Then select video tutorials on the left. “Custom Lists” is one of 6 video tutorials available.

We also have the video tutorials available on YouTube. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NojhfRFZxXM"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Watch the Custom List tutorial</a>.

<strong>Can you share custom lists you make on Articulation Station Pro?</strong>
Articulation Station Pro does not currently have the ability to share custom lists with other users.

<strong>Can you backup the custom lists on articulation Station or share them between your ipads on the same account?</strong>
You can backup all the data you have saved in Articulation Station from the scores screen. This backs up student scores, custom lists and custom images. You can restore that data on another device using the same Apple ID through iCloud. 

Here is a link to a video tutorial on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvyTxS3APgY"">how to backup and restore data in Articulation Station</a>. You can also access this video tutorial from the information screen in Articulation Station.

<strong>Will you be putting “language” tutorials onto the app (with the “artic” tutorials)?</strong>
We don’t currently have any plans for adding language tutorials in Articulation Station. 

<strong>Do you plan to add to Articulation Station by including some of these other lists such as categories, describing, function? Do you think a future update of Articulation Station will include some of these lists for language intervention pre-loaded?</strong>
Since the main function of Articulation Station is to target articulation goals we do not have any plans for making lists that target language goals available in the app at this time.

<strong>Is it possible to hide text within the app for sentence-level activities (like when you showed the video for working on WH questions)? Thinking of my students who are readers and would rely on the written text as a compensatory skill for auditory comprehension difficulties.</strong>
It is not currently possible to hide the text for words, phrases or sentences.

<strong>Is there a limit to how many custom images that can be added to Articulation Station Pro?</strong>
No. It is only limited by the space available on your iPad. But we have made a great effort to keep the file sizes low when saving custom images so they won’t take up too much space.

<strong>Can you use the original Articulation Station or do you need the Pro version to create custom lists and/or add custom images?</strong>
Custom images and custom lists are pro features. But you can upgrade to Pro from the original version which will unlock these features.

<strong>How can I access /ts/ in the medial position within Articulation Station?</strong>
We don’t currently have the /ts/ blend available in Articulation Station. You can add custom images of /ts/ words and save them to the medial /s/ program. Then you can select those words and create a custom list for them.

<strong>Do you have suggestions on how to use the app in a group setting, with 3-4 kids? I only have 1 iPad to work with.</strong>
Select the group feature (located on the bottom of the Home screen between Multiple Sounds and Settings), then select the students you would like to add to the group. You can work with up to 6 students at a time. Once you have selected the students tap begin. Then tap on the name of the student (found at the top of the screen) and select the activity you want to target. Each student can work on their own goals. You can switch between students at any time. 

For more information on group sessions you can access a video tutorial for Group Sessions from the information screen within the app or you can <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pOIbvnBxqY"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">watch the tutorial here</a>.

<strong>If using articulation station with a group is there a way to track/collect data individually?</strong>
When you end a group session and tap save all the data recorded will be saved to the individual student’s scores.

<strong>Is there a way to save groups?</strong>
Currently, there is not a way to save groups. You have to open the group feature and select the students you want in your group each time you meet with a group.

<strong>I haven't made the big purchase out of my materials budget yet, but am seriously considering it... Would you mind sharing which device you use/suggest?</strong>
I would suggest getting the newest (Apple) device you can afford so that you don’t miss out on new apps you may like because your operating system is too old.

Here is a great article you can read which shares research from a school district in America that wanted to determine which device is more effective for SLPs, Apple or Android and if Apps are more effective therapy tools compared to traditional therapy materials. It’s called, <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/is-the-tablet-an-effective-therapy-tool-for-speech-language-pathologists/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Is the Tablet an Effective Tool for Speech Language Pathologists?”</a> Hopefully it will help you make your decision.

<strong>Please review the speech intelligibility portion. Where can I find this within the app?</strong>
The speech intelligibility measure is found in Articulation Test Center Pro. After you have saved a recording for the speech sample you can access that speech sample from the data screen. When you open the speech sample you can choose to update the good, fair or poor rating to a percentage. If you choose percentage it will open the intelligibility rating tracker where you can tap a “+” for every word you understand and a “-” for every word you do not understand. In real time you can get an accurate intelligibility score.

<strong>Is the quality of the recording within the app adequate for some basic acoustic analysis?  If so, can it be exported?</strong>
The audio is good enough for basic acoustic analysis. You can email the recordings from Articulation Station Pro and you can email the speech samples from Articulation Test Center Pro.

<strong>Does Articulation Test Center evaluate students older than 6 years?</strong>
Articulation Test Center is a complete articulation evaluation tool. It assesses consonants, blends, vocalic Rs and vowels. It can be used for all ages. The screener is divided by age to save time by only testing the sounds that are developmentally appropriate. The 6+ screener can be used for 6 year olds and older. Although it does not test all the vocalic Rs and the vowels. If you want to test all the sounds you will have to do the full test in Articulation Test Center.

<strong>Can you print the results from Articulation Test Center?</strong>
Yes. You can email or print all the results from the screener, the full test and/or the speech sample.

<strong>What research/norms did you use to determine average age of acquisition?</strong>

<strong>Will Articulation Test Center be standardized in the near future? I would love to use this as an assessment tool that can help qualify a student but I need a standardized measure.</strong>
One of our favorite things about Articulation Test Center is how flexible it is. For that reason we do not have any plans at this time to standardize it. It is a criterion-referenced test that saves audio recordings for easy progress monitoring, it has thorough data tracking for goal setting, a summary of phonological processes present, the ability to make and save speech samples and an intelligibility measure that makes scoring intelligibility easier and more accurate. All these features make Articulation Test Center an outstanding choice as an additional measure for qualifying students for services.

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> states that it is inappropriate and unacceptable to base any eligibility decision upon the results of only one procedure and that using a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional and developmental information about the child is required. Additional measures may include observations, interviews, criterion-referenced tests, curriculum-based assessments, and so on.

<strong>Is the GFTA 3 included in your norms?</strong>
No.

<strong>Do you use the GFTA 3?</strong>
As a private practitioner I only use Articulation Test Center.

<strong>Is Articulation Test Center Pro the same as Articulation Station Pro?</strong> 
Articulation Test Center Pro and Articulation Station Pro are two separate apps.

<strong>Where do I find the Articulation Test Center Pro once the presentation is over? I can’t find it on the App Store.</strong>
Articulation Test Center Pro is only available on the iPad. You cannot find it in the App Store if you are searching for it on your iPhone. You have to search for it from your iPad.

<strong>I don’t currently own Articulation Test Center. Is some of the information you presented today available on your website because I would need some type of tutorial when I begin to use it?</strong>
Yes. There is a video tutorial on the <a href=""http://littlebeespeech.com/articulation_test_center_pro.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">website</a> as well as one in the app. To access the video tutorial from within the app tap on the information button on the home screen.

<strong>What app/program do you use to put your apps on the computer screen?  Or are you holding your ipad near the camera? Would love to be able to do this for teletherapy.</strong>
There are a couple of different options for mirroring your iPad to your computer screen. 
A great wireless option is an app called Reflector. Here is a link to the website for additional information. <a href=""http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/</a>
A great wired option is to hook your iPad to your computer with the usb cable it came with and open Quicktime, a video app from Apple. It’s a free download. Here is a link with more information on how to mirror your iPad screen to your computer (Mac) using Quicktime: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8yi9bJtkLY"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8yi9bJtkLY</a>
Here is a link to another app called Lonely Screen which is another wireless option that works great with a PC: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0Clw4q-nA"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA0Clw4q-nA</a>

<strong>Is there any way to pull up these apps onto a computer (either mac or pc)? It would be nice to use these apps during telepractice using a screen share function.</strong>
Our apps are only available on iOS devices (iPad, iPhone). 

<strong>Most of the time when I hook my iPad up to a larger screen monitor the sound for the app no longer works. Any suggestions?</strong>
I would suggest that you check the settings on the TV or projector that you’ve connected the iPad to. I would also suggest to make sure you have the correct cable that will provide both video and audio: <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202044"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202044</a>

<strong>Do you have logistic ideas on how to use your apps in teletherapy?</strong>
Since our apps are developed for iOS devices you'll have to be more creative but it is possible to use them in a teletherapy setting. I have never done teletherapy so I am not familiar with the software that can be used. One suggestion is from another SLP who does teletherapy and she said the following:  “I have used the apps in teletherapy - you need to share it, watch the kids mouse and then tap the device yourself.” Of course this is more challenging but it works for her. I will do some additional research on using apps in a teletherapy setting and post any additional information here that might be helpful.

<strong>Can you get articulation station on an HP touch screen laptop or is it only iPad or iPhone?</strong>
Articulation Station Pro is only available on the iPad and iPhone.

<strong>Will this be available for Windows or Android?</strong>
At the moment we are focused on developing for iOS however we are interested in Android and if we decide to develop for Android we will announce it on our Facebook page first so be sure and follow us! <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/littlebeespeech"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/littlebeespeech</a>

<strong>Did you use a word processor to make the word strips on the handouts?</strong>
The word strips that are found in the handouts were created in Adobe Illustrator.

<strong>How do you get admin to buy in to the value of using apps? We are so restricted.</strong>
That can be tough, especailly when budgets are limited. I would suggest having them read this research study done by a school district here in the US: <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/is-the-tablet-an-effective-therapy-tool-for-speech-language-pathologists/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Is the Tablet an Effective Therapy Tool for Speech Language Pathologists”</a>

<strong>Do you have a bilingual Articulation Test Center app?</strong>
Articulation Test Center is only available in English

<strong>Are these apps available for other languages?</strong> 
The only app we have available in another language is Articulation Station Español.

<strong>Heidi, I love your Spanish articulation app and use it daily. After seeing this presentation I have to know: Are you planning to add Stories to the Spanish app as well!???</strong>
We would love to add stories but we don’t have any plans to at this time.

<strong>Where do I get the handouts?</strong>
You can click the links at the top of the page to download the handouts.

<strong>What's the best way to contact you if we have any lingering questions?</strong>

How to Rate & Review an App on the App Store,how-to-rate-review-an-app-on-the-app-store,Little Bee,2018-03-15,App Store,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/01.png,"Reviews are an important component of the App Store. When you review an app it helps others learn about the app before they download or purchase it. Reviews are also very helpful to developers so we know what you like about our apps and what we can improve on. 

So, how do you review an app on the App Store?

<strong>Step 1.</strong>
Open the App Store on your iPad

How to Restore Purchases in Articulation Station Classic,how-to-restore-purchases-in-articulation-station,Little Bee,2019-02-28,App Store,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ipad_01.png,"<strong>Update:</strong> After many years of supporting SLPs all over the world, Articulation Station Classic has been officially retired, and is no longer available for download on the App Store. It has been replaced with <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/articulation-station-hive/id1485607474"" title=""Articulation Station Hive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>, which you can learn more about <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>. 

If you already own Articulation Station Classic, you can continue using it and purchase additional sound programs within the app, and the information in this article remains relevant.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you make purchases within Articulation Station (whether they be individual sounds or upgrade to pro) you will need to ""restore"" those purchases when you move the app onto another device. In-app purchases do not automatically transfer when you download the app onto another device. The good news is that it's a simple process to restore purchases and it's free, of course.

It's important to note that all purchases made within Articulation Station (and all of our other apps) are directly tied to the Apple ID that the purchases were made with. When restoring these purchases you MUST be signed in with that same Apple ID or the restore process will not work. Your Apple ID is comprised of an email address and a password. 

If you have forgotten your password or Apple ID you can visit <a href=""https://support.apple.com/apple-id"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apple's support page</a> for help.

If you are having issues restoring your purchases in Articulation Station chances are the Apple ID that is signed into the App Store on your device is not the same Apple ID that was used to make the purchase initially. To fix this there are a few extra steps to take to ensure that you can successfully restore your purchased sounds.

Follow the steps below to successfully restore your in-app purchases in Articulation Station. 

<strong>If you don't have Articulation Station currently installed on your device skip Step 1 and begin with Step 2.</strong>

<strong>Step 1.</strong> 
Delete Articulation Station (the free version) from your device. If you have saved data in the app that you wish to keep you will need to back it up to iCloud before you delete the app, otherwise you will lose the data. You can restore the data back to the app later.

Watch the video below for a tutorial on how to back up your data to iCloud. The video shows the Spanish version of Articulation Station but it's the exact same process for the English version.

<p><i>I'm excited to share this post with you on how to teach Story Structure to children. While it was written from my perspective, it was a combined effort with my colleague and dear friend JaNeal Freeman. I have learned so much from her over the past few years about stories. She is a gifted writer with a brilliant mind. She is the author of all the stories in our iPad app, <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_lite.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Little Stories</a> (<a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_lite.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lite</a> and <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_pro.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro</a>). I am so grateful she has shared her talents with all of us through her writing. Her stories are clever and creative and sure to delight both the young reader and their reading helpers. Collaborating with her over the past few years has been a joy. I hope you enjoy this post and find it useful in helping you teach story structure to your little ones.</i><br />
<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sig1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""81"" height=""51"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1645"" />

This past year I had the opportunity to volunteer in my daughter’s 2nd grade classroom. Every week I listened to children read and then retell a story. There were several students who struggled to know how to organize a story in such a way that they could retell it and have it make sense. I created some worksheets with my colleague, JaNeal Freeman, that really helped these students retell stories with more confidence and accuracy. We’d like to share those worksheets with those of you who are trying to teach story structure to your students or children.

Stories are an important form of communication. A story can be poignant, like when we share a meaningful moment from life, or it can be more ordinary, like when we tell someone about a great movie. Either way, story sharing is a way we connect with one another. Story is also a tool to help us understand the events of our lives more coherently. Still, storytelling is a skill and even at its most basic levels, it can be a challenge for some children to learn. When we teach children how to tell stories, we teach them to become better communicators.

In my experience, the best way to teach narrative to young children is to help them identify the beginning, middle, and end of a story. You might teach them to tell a story by using transition words ( e.g. first…, then…, and finally…) to represent and organize the beginning, middle, and end. While this will result in a sparse retell, the goal is to work with narrative in manageable chunks. But these are not random chunks—these are structures. All stories have a beginning, middle, and an end.

For example, you can break the story of <i>The Three Little Pigs</i> into three parts by saying,

<ul>
<p><b>Beginning:</b> <i>First,</i> there were three little pigs that built three houses.</p>

<p><b>Middle:</b> <i>Then,</i> a big bad wolf came along and threatened to blow their houses down.</p>

<p><b>End:</b> <i>Finally,</i> the three little pigs found safety in the third pig’s home made out of brick.</p>
</ul>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3_lil_pigs.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""398"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636"" />

You may notice that the above example acts more like a summary than a story. One reason for this is that <i>The Three Little Pigs</i> has multiple episodes (three pigs in three houses). It’s important to note that a story can have a single episode and still be complete. While such stories may be harder to come by (even in children’s literature), a simple story with a single episode is my preferred go-to when I begin teaching narrative.

<strong>The Five Story Structure Elements</strong>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/icons.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""191"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1640"" />

When a child has mastered the simple idea of beginning, middle, and end, they are ready to begin working with more distinct and purposeful structures. A story told with the five story structure elements results in a fully formed narrative. While a story with these elements may be very short, it will feel and sound complete.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/quote5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""206"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1642"" />

In fact, more complex stories generally contain a repetition of the second and third structures (complication and action). This story model is plot-driven and, thus, focuses on the basic skeleton or structure of narrative. Here is a basic overview of our simple and yet foundational approach:

<p style=""padding-left:25px;""><strong>Orientation:</strong> The orientation is the launching point of a story where the characters are introduced and their current circumstances are presented. It’s the <i>Who?</i> and <i>What?</i> that sets up the story.</p> 
<p style=""padding-left:50px;""><i>“Who are the characters and what are they doing when the story begins?""</i>
</p>

<p style=""padding-left:25px;""><strong>Complication:</strong> The complication is when a problem or condition arises that upsets the norm and pushes the character(s) to act.</p> 
<p style=""padding-left:50px;""><i>“What happened or what is the problem?”</i></p>

<p style=""padding-left:25px;""><strong>Action:</strong> The action is the efforts characters make to transform the situation and service their story goals.</p> 
<p style=""padding-left:50px;""><i>“What did the characters do to fix the problem?”</i></p>

<p style=""padding-left:25px;""><strong>Resolution:</strong> The resolution is the point in a story where the complication is worked out or resolved. It’s the moment of triumph or success over the problem.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:50px;""><i>“What happened that fixed things near the end of the story and how did it all turn out?”</i></p>

<p style=""padding-left:25px;""><strong>Ending:</strong> The ending is the signal that a story is over, often tying up loose ends, adding commentary, and enhancing the resolution.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:50px;""><i>“How are the characters feeling or what are they doing now that the problem is solved?”</i></p>

The Story Structure Elements are a workhorse for narrative. They serve as a framework that can help with both oral and written narrative tasks. They are useful for those who are challenged by language tasks as well as for those who could spend endless hours crafting creative stories. They really are for everyone.

<b>The Story Structure Cue Cards</b>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/story_structure_cards.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""506"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649"" />

We created story structure cue cards as prompts for children while they retell or write stories. These cue cards help children learn to organize and retell story events in the correct order. These cards are designed so you can cue the story structure elements with one side and the transition words with the other. The story structure elements help children identify the important parts of the story while the transition words help them connect ideas and prevent gaps in the story.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cards_rings.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""448"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1637"" />

These cue cards are designed so you can easily print, cut, and laminate them for repeated use. I punch a hole in the upper left corner and put the cue cards on a binder ring. This keeps them together and makes them easy to flip through. I’ve outlined a few steps below to help familiarize a child with these story structure cues.

<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">1. Teach what each story structure element means. 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">2. Have the students practice putting the story structure elements (the side with the big icons) in order.
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">3. Have the student identify the story structure elements in a story. For example, read part of a story to the child and then ask them to tell you if that sounds like the orientation, complication, action, resolution, or ending.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">4. Practice associated transition words common in story.<br>
<p style=""padding-left:75px;"">a. Orientation: Once there was a _______ who…, One day…, First…, First of all…<br>
<p style=""padding-left:75px;"">b. Complication: But…, Then…, However…, All of a sudden…<br>
<p style=""padding-left:75px;"">c. Action: So…, Next…<br>
<p style=""padding-left:75px;"">d. Resolution: Finally…, Eventually…<br>
<p style=""padding-left:75px;"">e. Ending: Now…, In the end… As a result…, In conclusion…, And that is why/how...
</p>
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">5. Have the student retell a story using the story structure cue cards as prompts. The child may flip through the prompts as they retell a story.
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">6. Have the child create their own story. Encourage them to use the cards to help them include each story element in the proper order.

<p>Now, let’s retell the story of <i>The Three Little Pigs</i> again using the transition words above. In  the exercise below, you will see how the story is more developed than our first example where we simply told the beginning, middle and end of the story.</p>

<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">1. Orientation: <b><i>Once there were</i></b> three little pigs who each built a home of their own.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">2. Complication: <b><i>But</i></b> the big bad wolf came along and blew down the first two pigs’ homes.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">3. Action: <b><i>So</i></b>, the first two pigs ran to the third pig’s home for safety.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">4. Resolution: <b><i>Finally</i></b>, the big bad wolf tried to blow down the third pig’s house. It was made of brick, so he couldn’t blow it down.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">5. Ending: <b><i>Now</i></b> the three pigs are safe in the third pig’s home, and the big bad wolf can’t bother them anymore.
</p>

In this retelling of <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>, you will notice that this summary is highly condensed. Like many classic and modern tales, this story follows the pattern of the rule of three. When we flush out the orientation and repeat the three complication-action episodes more deliberately, the story is shaped even more like the tale we have come to know.

<p>
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">1. Orientation: <i><b>Once there were</b></i> three little pigs who left home to build houses of their own. The first little pig built a house of straw. The second little pig built a house of sticks. The third little pig built a house of bricks. 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">2. Complication: <i><b>Bu</b>t</i> the big bad wolf came to the first little pig’s house. The wolf blew the house down because it was only made of straw.<br>
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">3. Action: <i><b>So</b></i>, the first little pig ran to the second pig’s home for safety.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">4. Complication: <i><b>But</b></i> the big bad wolf came to the second little pig’s house. The wolf blew the house down because it was only made of sticks.<br>
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">5. Action: <i><b>So</b></i>, the first two pigs ran to the third pig’s home for safety.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">6. Complication: <i><b>But</b></i> the big bad wolf came to the third pig’s house, and he said he would blow it down.<br>  
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">7. Action: <i><b>So</b></i>, the three pigs told him to go ahead and try.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">8. Resolution: <i><b>Finally</b></i>, the big bad wolf tried to blow down the third pig’s house. It was made of brick, so he couldn’t blow it down.<br> 
<p style=""padding-left:25px;"">9. Ending: <i><b>Now</b></i> the three pigs are safe in the third pig’s home, and the big bad wolf can’t bother them anymore.<br>
</p>

My eight year old daughter, knowing the story of <i>The Three Little Pigs</i> very well, pointed out that some of the most entertaining details are missing in the example above. For example, there are those three memorable moments when the Big Bad Wolf says, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” It is true that the story lacks its luster, but its skeleton is undeniably there. The point of this example is to demonstrate how using the transition words helps make sure all the key plot elements are included in the story. As children progress as storytellers, their experience in narrative will become richer as you encourage them to add details such as dialogue and descriptive passages. Still, don’t nudge them into this space too quickly. In the early stages, praise them when these extras arise, but keep your focus on the story structure.

The story structure cue cards are straightforward and adaptable. The <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/resources/story/story_structure_cue_cards.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Story Structure Cue Cards PDF</a> outlines six ways to use them, but I am sure there are more. I hope you’ll keep them with your teaching tools, and that you’ll pull them out often. In my opinion, they are indispensable!

<b>The Story Organizer</b>
</p> 

After the story structure elements are learned, a child is then ready to use a story organizer. Our <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/resources/story/story_organizer_activity.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">story organizer</a> allows a child (even one without writing skills) to capture story details on paper. This tool can enhance memory and organization in both retell and writing exercises. In the story organizer sheet below, there is a small box for the student to do a quick stick-drawing to represent each part of the story (pictograph). This simple stick drawing acts as a prompt to remind the child to include each part of the story when they retell or write it.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/story_organizer_activity.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""557"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1646"" />

One of the benefits of doing a quick drawing instead of writing words is that  it encourages children to break away from the story text. This in turn helps children come to the story with their own words. Stick drawings are encouraged specifically because they are less time consuming to produce than detailed drawings of the story. This is not supposed to be an illustration of the story; it is a quick task to aid memory and organization. Many children will benefit from a walk-through of this exercise. Pull out the Story Organizer and draw out the story details as you outline the story. Show your learner what a quick and easy stick drawing looks like. Perhaps add a few words to add emphasis or to prompt key details like character names. Be complete but sparse. Even you will get better the more you practice this. Most important of all, have fun. Make this a story activity, not a story drill.

Teresa Ukrainetz, a speech-language pathologist and professor at Utah State University, has done extensive work with pictographs. She says, “The pictographic representation of narratives is a useful strategy for both developing language and compensating for weak writing in individual and inclusive language intervention settings.”

For additional information see her article, <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254082941_The_immediate_effects_of_pictographic_representation_on_children's_narratives"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">“The Immediate Effects of Pictographic Representation on Children’s Narratives”</a>.</p>

I hope you enjoy using this worksheet as much as I have. As a practitioner, it has been interesting for me to watch my students grapple with and then grasp story concepts as they work through this exercise. It gives me a peek into their thinking process, and it helps me better understand how they process narrative. I believe that because this is a “drawing” activity it feels less threatening to a student, but trust me, it is serious work, too!

<b>Tracking Progress and Other Story Work</b>
</p> 

As a speech-language pathologist I am always looking for measurable ways to track progress. So, of course, developing an effective way to measure a child’s understanding of story structure through story retell was very important to me. There are a lot of different ways of taking data, so if you have a system that works for you, I encourage it.

If you’d like to check out the system we created, you can try it for free on three different stories in our app <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_lite.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Little Stories Lite</a>, for iPad. We created Little Stories (<a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_lite.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lite</a> and <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_pro.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro</a>) to target Speech, Language and Literacy goals. Each story is 100 words, which makes it a manageable length to get through in a quick therapy session. The Pro version of Little Stories has 82 stories to choose from which gives you a lot of story options.

<a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/little-stories-lite/id1327557030""><img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/little_stories_app-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""418"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1718"" /></a>

In the retell section of our <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_lite.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Little Stories app</a>, you can have the child listen to the story or read it. Then you can record the child as they retell the story. After the child has finished retelling the story you can score their response by playing back their retell, and while listening, scoring their responses. Five questions are asked to measure how well they did at including each of the five story elements in their retell. For example, the first question asks, “Did the student begin the story by introducing the characters and scene? Then the user selects, “Yes,” “No,” or “Somewhat.” If you are not sure how to evaluate their responses, we have provided examples of appropriate responses. After answering all five questions the student receives a score for their retell.

I always like to record the child retelling the story in our story retell activity before I do any teaching so I can get a baseline of how well they understand story structure. If I discover they need more support retelling the story, I like to do the sequencing activity in <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_lite.php"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Little Stories</a> next. The sequencing activity breaks the story up into 4 of the 5 story elements we discussed above (Orientation, complication, action, and resolution). It is a shorter, simpler version of the story.

After the child has sequenced the story, I pull out the <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/resources/story/story_organizer_activity.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Story Organizer worksheet</a>. (Not included in the app. You can download it <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/resources/story/story_organizer_activity.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.) Then I have them do a quick pictograph for each part of the story. Usually a child will need prompts and other guidance when they first begin working with pictographs. When a student seems ready, I have them retell the story again using their pictographs. After they get good at retelling the story using their pictographs, I have them retell stories using the <a href=""http://www.littlebeespeech.com/resources/story/story_structure_cue_cards.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Story Structure Cue Cards</a>. When they have mastered retelling stories with the cue cards, then I have them practice retelling stories with no prompts at all.

Once a child has mastered retelling the story, meaning they remember to include each story element when retelling the story (without prompts), I encourage them to add more details and expression to their story. Finally, when they can retell a story with all the story elements, interesting details, and good expression, I congratulate them for becoming master storytellers. A fun way to celebrate their success may be to have a story festival where the students can tell each other stories. Another fun way to celebrate their achievements is to record their oral stories in a way that could be shared with their parents or guardians. They may also like to write their stories down to save in a book. After all, stories are more fun when they are shared!

This post is long, but we wanted to bring our best and give you our best. Story is a gift. It is loaded with potential for learning and connecting.  Whether a story is written in a book or told orally, whether it is silly or serious, whether it is centuries old or a new release, it holds a distinct place in language and culture. JaNeal and I have both felt the power of a well-told story. We have been in classes and have seen it bring a hush on the restless. We have seen it invite laughter and group play. Very significant to us, we have seen it act as an equalizer among children of different abilities and needs. Story brings learning, and that is important to us. But perhaps most important of all, story helps us understand each other. It helps us navigate life.

So, here’s our invitation. Use story. Use it to teach. Use it to connect. Use it to bring out the best in yourself and others. And, if our resources help you do this, we will be grateful for the opportunity we had to share them.

<i><strong>JaNeal Freeman</strong> entered the world of speech-language pathology when she and her pre-school child enrolled in an early intervention program provided by their school district. In this setting she worked with wonderful professionals who encouraged her to surround her child with target sounds through purposeful language. Being an avid reader and writer of children’s stories, she quickly came to recognize a gap in the stories that were available for such specific needs. This became a major motivation for her to earn a master’s degree in reading with a concentration in storytelling from East Tennessee State University. JaNeal loves how working for Little Bee Speech brings plenty of opportunities to use her creative and critical thinking. She also loves working with the Little Bee team!<br/>

How To Mirror Your iPad for Teletherapy,how-to-mirror-your-ipad-for-teletherapy,Little Bee,2020-03-25,Teletherapy,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sale-1.jpg,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/feature_image_mirroring.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""459"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1704"" />

<strong>Update:</strong> Articulation Station Hive is now available on the Mac computer (silicon Macs only)... which means you no longer need to mirror your iOS device to your computer screen to use this software if you have a silicon Mac. For additional details click <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-is-on-the-mac/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ve been asked many times by speech-language pathologists if they can use our apps for teletherapy and the answer is yes! While our mobile apps do not work natively on a desktop or laptop computer (they only work on mobile devices like an iPad), you can still use them in teletherapy. 

The best way to use our apps in a teletherapy setting is to mirror your iPad screen to your computer and then share your computer screen with your student using the teletherapy software.

It's important to note that when mirroring your iPad screen to your computer your student will not be able to interact directly with your iPad as they would if you were sitting with them in person. This will require a little creativity on your part when using the app together with your student but as you find your rhythm you'll see just how fun and effective it can be.

Most teletherapy (or video conferencing) platforms have the option to share your computer screen but many don’t offer a way to mirror your iPad screen to your computer. So, here are a few options for screen mirroring your iPad to your computer so that you can use our apps in teletherapy:

<strong>1. Zoom</strong>
If you are using the popular video conferencing platform Zoom, you will have the option of sharing your computer screen but additionally you have the option of also mirroring your iPad to your computer. This is a great all-in-one option. See the following links for details on how to do this using Zoom.

<strong>2. Reflector</strong>
Reflector is a popular screen mirroring software for both Mac and Windows allows you to easily and wirelessly mirror iOS devices to your computer. We've used Reflector many times and it's a great solution.

<strong>3. AirServer</strong>
AirServer is another popular screen mirroring software for both Mac and Windows that allows you to easily and wirelessly mirror iOS devices to your computer. Check out the links below for details on using AirServer.

<strong>4. Quicktime</strong>
Quicktime Player is a free Mac application (also available for Windows) used for video editing and playback but it will also allow you to share your iPad screen with your computer. This option requires your iPad to be connected to your computer with a charging cable. See the links below for details on using Quicktime to mirror your iPad screen to your computer.

<strong>5. Document Camera</strong>
It's worth mentioning that you can also use a document camera to share your iPad screen to your computer. While this isn't the most ""techy"" way of using mobile apps in teletherapy we've spoken with SLPs that have had great success using this method. Any modern document camera will have the ability to connect with your computer. A quick search online and you should find some reasonably priced document camera options. Check out the link below on how to use a document camera.

<p>If you are a speech-language pathologist and currently use and love our most popular app Articulation Station, then you're going to LOVE this next generation articulation therapy tool for your iPad, iPhone and silicon Mac. Introducing... <strong>Articulation Station Hive</strong>! 🎉</p>

<p>While Articulation Station Hive may resemble the familiar and beloved Articulation Station, it is a new software solution that has been completely rebuilt from scratch with more than twice the activities, features and content. It is bursting at the seams with so much articulation sweetness we know you’re going to LOVE it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Articulation Station Hive is professional speech therapy software. Little Bee Hive members will enjoy access to both Articulation Station Hive (for treatment) and Articulation Test Center Hive (for assessment) in the Little Bee Hive membership.</p>

<p><a href=""https://little-bee-speech-tutorials-and-faqs.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-little-bee-hive-membership""><img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hive_membership.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""350"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3847"" /></a></p>

<p>Articulation Station Hive has all the tools and activities speech-language pathologists need to teach their learners how to speak more clearly. To start with, it has activities to target speech in both <strong>consonants and vowels from the isolation level through the conversation level.</strong></p>

<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1897"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_levels-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""145"" /></p>

<p>The icons for each of these levels represent a pattern of growth and progression as your learners move through each level, develop their sounds and become more confident in their speaking abilities. We know that through small and simple daily practice, big things can happen!</p>

<p>So let's take a look at what Articulation Station Hive offers:</p>

<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1899"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_level_icon_isolation-3.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""120"" /></p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sound in Isolation</strong></h1>
<p>The isolation activities provide fun and engaging opportunities for learners to practice sounds in isolation as they begin their journey to speaking more clearly.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1903"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_isolation_activities-3.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""170"" /></p>
<p><strong>Hand Cue</strong><br />A hand cue enhances the teaching of a new sound in isolation because it provides a visual prompt that suggests how and when to say the sound. In our hand cue activity, learners can play the video example of the hand cue and the associated sound.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_hand_cue-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""445"" /></p>
<p>As progress is made, learners can feel a sense of satisfaction as they audio record themselves imitating the cue and producing the sound. In practice, a hand cue can serve as a subtle way to remind a learner of when and how a particular sound is used; a gesture has an advantage in that the reminder can come without a verbal correction.</p>
<p><strong>Picture Cue</strong><br />The picture cue is a fun way to connect something meaningful with the sound. For example, learners who are working on the “popping” sound (p) can pop the balloon in the picture cue activity for the associated sound. While working on the “ChEEsey-E Sound” sound, they can say “eeee” each time smiley Cheese strikes his cute little pose.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1979"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_picture_cue-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690
"" height=""445"" /></p>
<p><strong>Letter Cue</strong><br />The letter cue activity is a fun way to connect the sound with the letter that represents it. Learners can practice saying their target sound as they tap on the letter that corresponds with their target sound. This is a great activity for speech and phonological awareness!</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1983"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_letter_cue-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""445"" /></p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1934"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_level_icon_syllables-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""120"" /></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sound in Syllables</strong></h1>
<p>Once the sound is said correctly in isolation, the sound is ready to be practiced in syllables. You will have the option to practice with the syllable sliders or spinners. Before you begin the activity you will select the sound position you want to practice the target sound in--initial or final.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2008"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_syllables_activities-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""150"" /></p>
<p><strong>Syllable Sliders</strong><br />Syllable sliders allow the learner to put two sounds together to make a real word (CV or VC), or a nonsense syllable. Children love to see what words they can make with their sounds or what silly monsters they can create with nonsense syllables. The Syllable Sliders activity really helps them see how meaningful sounds can be.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1964"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_syllable_slider.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>

<p><strong>Syllable Spinners</strong><br />Syllable spinners allow the learner to practice one, two, and three syllables at a time. It is a lot of fun to see what word combinations will spin in next. Practicing the sound with targeted syllables helps make the transition from saying the sound in isolation to saying the sound in words a little easier.</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2097"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_syllable_spinners-1-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sound in Words</strong></h1>
<p>Sound work at the word level can be very satisfying because you can build vocabulary while improving articulation. You will be given the choice to practice the sound in minimal pairs, flashcards, or matching activities.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2017"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_word_activities-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""150"" /></p>
<p><strong>Minimal Pairs</strong><br />The minimal pairs activity is recommended when learners consistently substitute one sound for another, or when they consistently omit a sound. Teaching minimal pairs helps learners see that when they substitute one sound for another, or when they omit a sound, it can actually change the meaning of the word.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1938"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_minimal-pairs-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p>When the activity begins, the target word will be displayed below two pictures. Have the learner identify which picture represents the word displayed on the card by moving the slider to the correct picture. Then have the learner practice saying each word correctly. Students learn to better distinguish both words as they are exposed to their subtle differences. :)</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1939"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_minimal-pairs-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p><strong>Flashcards</strong><br />Flashcards are a quick and reliable tool for focused repetition in speech practice. Articulation Station uses real photographic images for better clarity and sound practice. Once in the flashcard activity, have the learner say the word that is pictured on each card. Listen for correct productions of the target sound and score each response appropriately. Words that are scored can be reviewed later from the student’s saved session scores.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1921"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_flashcard.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p><strong>Matching</strong><br />You may also practice words through matching. The matching game is a fun way to keep kids (and adults) of all ages engaged in the activity as they practice sounds in words.</p>
<p>There are 3 different difficulty levels in the matching activity to accommodate each learner on their level. After a card has been turned over, take a moment and score the learner’s speech production before you tap another card. All of the scores will be associated with each word practiced. When all of the matches have been made, you may choose to play again with a new board for more practice.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1937"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_matching.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""556"" /></p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1931"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_level_icon_phrases-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""120"" /></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sound in Phrases</strong></h1>
<p>Once a sound has been mastered at the word level, it is time to practice the sound in phrases. Phrases are a nice bridge between words and sentences because of the simplicity of two- and three-word combinations. There are two different phrase activities to choose from – rotating phrases and unique phrases.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2024"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_phrases_activities-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""150"" /></p>
<p><strong>Rotating Phrases</strong><br />Rotating phrases are two-word phrases with a lead word and a target word. The target word has the practice sound in the targeted position. Both the lead words and the target words have spin buttons associated with them, allowing the user to spin one or the other and thereby produce hundreds of word combinations.</p>
<p>With each word combination you can also talk about whether the phrase makes sense or not. For example, if “yummy pants” resulted from a spin, (“yummy” being the lead word and “pants” being the target word), the phrase would be considered a silly or nonsense phrase. It’s these phrases that really put a smile on the kids’ faces and make the activity so much fun!</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1945"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_phrases_rotating.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p>The lead word or the target word can be locked, allowing you to focus on more specific targets. For example, if you want to work on the pronoun “my” with every target word, you could tap and find the lead word “my” and then lock it into place by holding it down for two seconds. The learner will only be able to spin the target word, practicing phrases like “my purse” and “my pig.”</p>
<p><strong>Unique Phrases</strong><br />Each unique phrase is a three-word phrase. This makes them the perfect next step following rotating phrases. Additionally, these phrases are generally descriptive phrases which can assist you in language goals such as describing things. Additional examples of unique phrases are “hot baked potato” and “cute little puppy.”</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sound in Sentences</strong></h1>
<p>Sentence work is critical for building fluency in speech and language. There are two types of sentence activities to practice sounds – rotating sentences (fixed and mixed) and unique sentences.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2027"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_sentence_activities-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""150"" /></p>
<p><strong>Fixed Rotating Sentences</strong><br />Fixed rotating sentences are like long “carrier phrases” where the sentence stays the same and only one target word changes. A mostly fixed sentence allows the learner to memorize the sentence and practice it with greater fluency. For example, in “Sally sang a song about the <em>sandwich</em>” the variable target word is “sandwich.” Note that each rotating sentence contains multiple targets and accompanying pictures where possible. This activity provides immersion with surprise and flexibility with fun!</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1955"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_sentences_rotating.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p><strong>Mixed Rotating Sentences</strong><br />Mixed rotating sentences are a fun and silly way to practice target words in sentences. Tap the button and watch as a new pronoun, verb, adjective, and target word spin into position. Sometimes the sentence will make sense and sometimes it won’t. Either way it is an entertaining way to get learners talking.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1954"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_sentences_rotating_mixed.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p><strong>Unique Sentences</strong><br />Unique sentences are usually longer and at times more complex than the rotating sentences. Each unique sentence is sound saturated, providing multiple opportunities to practice the target sound. For example, in “My dog Spot has lots of <em>spots</em>” the target word is “Spot” in the example below. The opportunity to practice the initial sp sound also comes with the word “spots”. Extra targets offer more practice opportunities!</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1956"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_sentences_unique.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1933"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_level_icon_stories-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""120"" /></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sound in Stories</strong></h1>
<p>Story work is a place where building sound fluency begins to approximate everyday language. Once a sound has been mastered in sentences, it is ready for practice in stories. The story level activities have options to practice the sound in a simple story (level 1) or a more complex story (level 2).</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2034"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_story_activities-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""150"" /></p>
<p><strong>Level 1 Stories</strong><br />The Level 1 stories are short, rhyming, and sometimes repetitive stories paired with picture prompts. Readers can read the story but focus their primary work on the target words. Non-readers can retell the story after hearing it from an adult. Non-readers often feel a sense of satisfaction as they “read” the story through their retelling.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1960"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_story_level_1-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p>At the end of each story there are comprehension questions. This provides an opportunity to practice the target sound in more spontaneous speech.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2038"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_story_level_1-2-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>
<p><strong>Level 2 Stories</strong><br />The Level 2 story is a longer story with larger vocabulary and even more opportunities to practice the target sound in a story environment. There are comprehension questions at the end of this story as well. The questions test comprehension and retention and provide yet another opportunity to practice the target sound.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1962"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_story_level_2-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""611"" /></p>

<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1929"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_level_icon_conversation-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""120"" /></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sound in Conversation</strong></h1>
<p>With so many steps along the way, fluency in conversation is the ultimate goal in speech and language practice. Once the target sound has been mastered all the way through the story level, it is time to practice the sound in conversation. Articulation Station Hive has two really fun activities for practicing the sound in conversation: <strong>conversation scenes</strong> and <strong>conversation questions</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2041"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_conversation_activities-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""150"" /></p>
<p><strong>Conversation Scenes</strong><br />In each of our amazing and beautiful conversation scenes, the learner can scroll from right to left to explore the scene. A speech sample can be recorded and saved to score later, or their speech productions can be scored while they explore the scene.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1911"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_conversation_1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""230"" /></p>

<p>Your learners can also tap on different elements in the scene for conversation prompts about each illustrated detail. The kids love how interactive the scenes are, and you will love talking about all the things they discover.</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2111"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_conversation_3-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""524"" /></p>
<p><strong>Conversation Questions</strong><br />Articulation Station Hive contains four different types of conversation questions to keep the conversation going. You may choose a specific set of questions or you may do a combination of questions. Once you begin the activity, you will be presented with 20 randomly generated questions from your selected category. You may record and score the conversation just as you have done in the previous activities.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_conversation_4.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""474"" /></p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Scoring and Recording</strong></h1>
<p>Scoring is the same throughout all the activities in Articulation Station Hive, from isolation to conversation. Score correct, approximate, and incorrect productions with the scoring buttons on the right (green check, yellow approximate symbol, and red X). If you score something by mistake you can tap the score in the upper right hand corner to undo the last score.</p>

<p>Tap the record button on the lower left corner of the screen to record each speech production. Recording and playing back a learner’s speech productions can help the teacher keep accurate data while also allowing the learner to self monitor their own speech. At the end of each session, you will have the opportunity to save the score and any associated recordings in order to track progress. To view scores, tap on the scores icon at the lower left corner of the home page.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2001"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_dock_icon-4.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""120"" /></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Dock</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Additional Activities, Scoring, and Resources</strong><br />The dock is an important command center for Articulation Station Hive. From the dock you can access scores, phonological processes, multiple sounds, custom words, group sessions, and other resources.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1918"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_dock_home.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""524"" /></p>
<p><strong>Scores</strong><br />Scoring is central to tracking and understanding progress. From the scores screen you can view a summary of all your students’ sessions, and see graphs of your students’ performances on all targeted sounds or on individual sounds.</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2151"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_scores.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""523"" /></p>
<p>You can also tap on a session for more session details. Here you will be able to view the errors and the correct responses from the session. You can write and view notes, listen to recordings, and repeat the session from here. You can also share progress and notes with parents or adult users.</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2150"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_scores_2-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""523"" /></p>
<p>Additional data management features allow you to manage your recordings, move scores to a different student, and sync your data across multiple devices.</p>
<p><strong>Phonological Processes</strong><br />You can target specific phonological processes by tapping on the Phonological Processes button in the dock. As you select each process a definition of the process will appear on the right with an example of the process, and information on the typical age of elimination.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1949"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_processes.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""511"" /></p>
<p>When the first flashcard comes on the screen, it will be a single word. You may choose to practice phonological processes in single words only. If you desire practice of phonological processes while using minimal pairs, tap the orange pairs button in the upper right corner of the card and the pair will be shown.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Sounds</strong><br />The multiple sounds feature gives the user the flexibility to create word lists that focus on a learner’s individual needs. To target more than one sound at a time, tap on the Multiple Sounds button in the dock. Then select the sounds and positions you want to target.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1941"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_multiple_sounds.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""514"" /></p>
<p>You may modify your list by selecting the number of syllables, deselecting words, or adding suggested words and custom words. Once you have made your modifications, you may save your list to access later. Once you have made your selection, tap the Next button. Then you may choose to target the sounds in words, phrases, or sentences.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1940"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_multiple_sounds_2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""622"" /></p>
<p><strong>Custom Words</strong><br />Articulation Station Hive allows you to add images and words that will help personalize it. Speech activities can become more engaging when personalized target words are taken from a learner’s interests and environment and then integrated into learning activities.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1917"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hive_custom_word.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""783"" /></p>
<p><strong>Groups</strong><br />You can easily work with groups of students (up to 6 at a time) in Articulation Station Hive. Group sessions are typical in school settings but they can also be meaningful in private practice. Students work together taking turns in the group session and the scores are saved and stored under each student's individual name at the end of the session. It's like magic!</p>

<p><strong>Settings</strong><br />The settings allow you to modify your experience in many ways. The most fun and visual change is the ability to change the theme. There are seasonal themes, holiday themes, just-for-fun themes, and multiple colored backgrounds. Changing the theme can make Articulation Station Hive feel new again as it keeps kids more engaged and provides adults with an age-appropriate experience.</p>

With the introduction of <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"">Articulation Station Hive</a> we wanted to highlight some of the key differences between Articulation Station Pro and Articulation Station Hive.

We are proud of Articulation Station Pro and how well it has served so many for so long. However, considering the older technology it was built with (over 10 years ago), it became clear that if we really wanted this product to be the best it can be we needed to rebuild it from scratch using current development tools and technology. 

So, in January of 2022 we were thrilled to welcome Articulation Station Hive to our Little Bee Speech family! 🎉 

Articulation Station Hive is built on the foundation and principles found in Articulation Station Pro so it will be familiar to current users of Articulation Station Pro... but it has so much more to offer.

The comparison table below does not show <em>all</em> the differences between these Articulation Station Pro and Articulation Station Hive but it highlights the key differences between them.

Articulation Station Hive is available on Apple silicon Macs and it can be downloaded on the Mac App Store. 🎉 

<strong>What is a ""silicon Mac""? </strong>
Apple has integrated its own custom-made processor chips in its new Macs instead of using Intel’s processor chips, which it had been using for decades. Apple’s own processors are called Apple ""silicon"" chips (M1 & M2) and are similar to the chips used in iPhones and iPads.

Apple silicon Macs were introduced in late 2020 and the M1 & M2 processing chips make them more powerful and more energy efficient.

If you have purchased a new Mac within the last couple of years it's most likely a silicon Mac.

Check Apple's website <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a> to see a list of the Apple silicon Macs that are compatible with Articulation Station Hive. If your Mac is not on this list it will not work with Articulation Station Hive.

<strong>Little Bee Hive Subscribers:</strong>
You can download Articulation Station Hive for your Apple silicon Mac at no additional cost. The Mac version is included in your subscription price. Simply download it from the Mac App Store then sign in with your Little Bee Hive account credentials. Easy peasy!

<strong>Group Extended Trial</strong>
Groups with 5 or more SLPs (e.g., school districts, clinics) qualify for an extended FREE trial. Just fill out <a href=""https://form.jotform.com/251664485186164"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" title="""">this form</a> to get started!

If you are a Speech Language Pathologist you are well aware of how successful the minimal pairs approach is when working with students. The drawback is accessing the minimal pairs you need when you need them. There are just so many different substitutions our students can make for the sound in error!

This is why we have been working hard to make sure you have the minimal pairs you need, when you need them, right at your fingertips (no printing, cutting, storing or organizing required).

We are excited to announce that we have added 836 new pair sets and a total of more than 4,700 pairs. That means <strong>we now have over 7,500 pairs in Articulation Station Hive!</strong> 

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/7500_pairs-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""287"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2469"" />

Imagine how much it would cost to purchase 7,500 minimal pairs cards from a publisher… Wowzas! With Articulation Station Hive you get all these easily accessible pairs at a cost MUCH, MUCH less than purchasing them in paper form… and this includes all the other amazing features and activities Articulation Station Hive offers!

<strong>Using Minimal Pairs in Articulation Station Hive</strong>

You can use minimal pairs in Articulation Station Hive to work on auditory bombardment by sliding between the pictures and tapping on the picture for an audio example of each word. 

You can work on auditory discrimination by having the child identify the correct picture of the printed word. Or you can work on speech production by having the child say each word.

<br></br>

You can easily access the minimal pairs in <strong>phonological processes</strong> or in <strong>phonemes</strong> with Articulation Station Hive. You can also use the pairs to target multiple oppositions.

<strong>Target Pairs in Phonological Processes</strong>

Target minimal pairs in phonological processes by opening the dock in Articulation Station Hive. Then select phonological processes and choose the process you want to target. Select the sound position and the pair sets you want to target. Then select the pairs you want to practice. Once the activity begins tap the orange pairs icon in the upper corner of the card. Then slide between the two words.

<br></br>

<strong>Practice Minimal Pairs in Phonemes</strong>

To practice minimal pairs in phonemes select the phoneme you want to practice. Then select words and minimal pairs. Select the sound position you want to target and the pair set or sets you want to practice. Review the pairs offered and select which pairs you want to target. Then begin.

<br></br>

<strong>Multiple Oppositions</strong>

Multiple oppositions can be practiced by opening the target phoneme from the home screen, selecting words and minimal pairs. Then select the sound position you want to target and all the pair sets you want to practice. 

For example, if you want to contrast k with t, m & g select k/t, k/m & k/g from within the k program.  Then tap on “deselect all” (found at the bottom of the pairs on the iPhone). Then scroll to find words with a contrast pair for all the phonemes you want to contrast. Select pairs that have a contrasting word for each sound. You might select cap/tap, cap/map and cap/gap or coat/tote, coat/moat and coat/goat. Once you begin you can easily swipe through the pairs comparing the target word with the contrast pair.

<p>Articulation Test Center Hive (ATC Hive) is based on our popular articulation assessment tool, Articulation Test Center Pro (released in 2013). While it has a similar look and feel, it has been completely rewritten and improved in almost every way. Still, the utility and flexibility you know and love in our three testing options (the Screener, the Full Test, and the Speech Sample) remain the same. Little Bee Hive members will now enjoy access to both Articulation Test Center Hive and Articulation Station Hive in the Little Bee Hive membership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<a href=""https://little-bee-speech-tutorials-and-faqs.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-little-bee-hive-membership""><img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hive_membership.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""350"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3847"" /></a>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ATC Hive streamlines the assessment process in multiple ways. The adaptable test formats combined with the software’s reporting tools help SLPs more easily see test outcomes and trends so they can clearly set goals and needed interventions. It also simplifies communication with parents, teachers, and others involved in the intervention process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will first introduce the <strong>Screener</strong> and the <strong>Full Test</strong> because these two tests share a lot of the same operations and formats. But make sure you read about the <strong>Speech Sample</strong> near the end of this post! The Speech Sample has an amazing capacity to pull everything together and give you an overall picture of a student’s speech and language skills in conversation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""x-large""} -->
<p class=""has-x-large-font-size""><strong>The Screener and the Full Test</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Screener</strong> assesses the sounds that are developmentally appropriate based on age. When a screener is selected, the sounds tested are displayed so the SLP can choose the appropriate screener based on the student’s age and the sounds desired for testing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/03_atc_hive.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""340"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2602"" />

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The<strong> Full Test</strong> assesses all the speech sounds in the English language including consonants, vowels, vocalic Rs, and initial blends. This test is designed for maximum flexibility. Click the red Full Test button to test all of the sounds. Click a blue test button or any combination thereof to customize the sounds you test.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the test begins the test administrator can easily mark sound errors, substitutions, omissions, phonological processes, and distortions. Audio can be recorded and saved allowing the test administrator to score or edit the scores at a later time. Notes can be taken during the test or after the test has been administered.</p>

<p class=""has-large-font-size""><strong>Recording Features in the Screener and the Full Test</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recording features in ATC Hive are both intuitive and useful. The record button (located next to each stimulus card) automatically restarts as each stimulus card is advanced. This allows each word to be recorded in its own file, further increasing the flexibility and use of the recording. The playback button is above the record button.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>
<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/06_atc_hive.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""477"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2618"" />
<br>
<br>
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a child does not recognize the stimulus, you can tap the image for an audio model. The record features are designed to help you administer the tests as you most prefer; thus, you can turn off the record button and/or the audio model in settings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""large""} -->
<p class=""has-large-font-size""><strong>Scoring Features in the Screener and the Full Test</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The green tiles located at the top of each stimulus card act as the command center for your test. The scoring actions are easy for the tester to master and are designed to be subtle, thus minimizing distractions for the student. These green tiles indicate which sound or sounds are being tested, and the sound being tested is displayed phonetically below. The simple scoring techniques are explained below, and it becomes even easier when your device is in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Correct</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>By default, the scoring tiles are green, marking the sounds tested as correct. If no speech errors are made on the sounds tested, simply proceed to the next stimulus card by swiping the card to the left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/07_atc_hive.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""175"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2619"" />

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Incorrect</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a sound being tested is said incorrectly, tap the tile once and it will turn red. A red tile indicates the sound is now marked as incorrect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/09_atc_hive.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""175"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2621"" />

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Approximate</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To mark a sound as approximate, tap the card again and it will turn from red to yellow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/08_atc_hive.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""175"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2620"" />

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Omitted</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fourth tap will mark the tile as omitted. You can also mark a sound as omitted by simply swiping the green sound tile away from its position. In both marking instances, a gray tile for that sound will then show an omission symbol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Error Menu</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To mark substitutions, phonological processes, or distortions, tap the Error Menu button on the right margin next to the stimulus card. The error menu will appear with the option to choose consonants, vowels, processes, or distortions. To remove the Error Menu and uncover the stimulus card, tap the Error Menu button again.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Substitutions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To mark a substitution, go to the Consonants or Vowels tabs at the top of the Error Menu and locate the incorrect sound that was said. Drag the red sound tile that corresponds with error and drop it on top of the green sound tile that was being elicited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>
<br>
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Phonological Processes</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most phonological processes will be automatically marked when a substitution is made if auto-marking is turned on in the ATC Hive Settings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>
<br>
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To mark a phonological process that is not auto-marked, tap the 'Processes' tab at the top of the Error Menu. Then drag and drop the process name over the scoring tile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<p><strong>Settings</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have designed ATC Hive to be flexible and serviceable. Settings like turning off the record button or the voice prompt have already been highlighted, but you can do more to customize your testing experience. For example, you can rotate the image to face the other way when you sit across from your student. You can also turn off sound effects when you need a quieter testing environment. The auto-mark features can also be disabled when desired.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""has-large-font-size""><strong>The Speech Sample</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <strong>Speech Sample</strong> provides a wonderful opportunity to test a student’s speech and language skills in connected speech, and it provides a more accurate measure of intelligibility. This test offers two engaging speech scenes that are designed to be fun, flexible, and interactive. It also provides opportunities for you to let your student take the lead in conversation. An audio sample can be recorded while the child explores and talks about the scene. This allows the tester to be more present in conversation and it also provides a record for assessment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The speech sample portion of the test can be used to assess the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• intelligibility</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• articulation skills in conversation</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• language skills including syntax, semantics, morphology, and pragmatics</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• mean length of utterance (MLU)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• fluency&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will automatically be presented with the opportunity to use the<strong> Speech Sample</strong> at the end of the <strong>Screener</strong> or the <strong>Full Test</strong>. You can also select the Speech Sample at any time from the home screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Begin by selecting the speech scene you want to explore. You can take an adventurous ride in the Mountain Adventure scene. Here you will find animals big and small as well as engaging outdoor activities. A fun contrast to the outdoor adventure is the Home Life scene. Here you will find family, friends, and neighbors in a wide variety of everyday activities. From making dinner to backyard birthday parties, there are a lot of great things to talk about.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/23_atc_hive.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""345"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2635"" />
<br>
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In both speech scenes, you and your student will enjoy our tap-and-talk feature. Simply tap on images to reveal questions that can help further your conversation. Not only does this help create continuing opportunities to talk, it also has the capacity to help your learner feel like they have ownership in the conversation as they select images they want to talk about.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Speech Sample is so easy to use. If you wish to record, simply tap the Record button in the lower left corner of the screen. A counter below the Record button will keep track of the length of the recording. Explore the full scene by swiping from right to left. When you are done with your speech sample, tap the Done button in the upper left hand corner of the screen to save your recording and end the session. That’s it! It’s simple in execution but invaluable in assessment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Scores Overview</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scores summary screen is designed to give you an assessment snapshot on each of your students. It displays a student identifier, progress graphs for Percent Phonemes Correct and Intelligibility, and a list of tests given. Tap in further for a wealth of data, lists, and reporting features.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>% Phonemes Correct (PPC) Graph</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Percent Phonemes Correct graph provides foundational data that is graphed according to the age of acquisition. This allows progress to be measured against the same set of sounds regardless of the test given. When you tap a data point on the graph, information including the test date and the overall Percent Phonemes Correct (PPC) for that test will be given. To see which sounds are included in each sound set, tap on the age of acquisition below the graph.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Intelligibility Rating Graph</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Intelligibility Rating Graph is a useful tool to indicate progress. Intelligibility is graphed based on the rating of “Good, Fair or Poor” assigned at the end of the test. If a percentage is assigned to the speech sample, that is graphed as well with a black data point.&nbsp; When you tap a data point on the graph, the intelligibility rating and test date will be displayed.</p>

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tests Administered</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each test given is listed on the lower portion of the scores summary screen. The list includes the test date, the age of the child on the test date, the name of the test administered, the overall Percent Phonemes Correct, the intelligibility rating, and whether the test is complete or incomplete.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Test Details</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To see the details of individual tests, tap the pertinent test. You will find the results organized by Words Tested, Errors Marked, Speech Sample, Report, and Recommendations.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sound Errors&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Sound Errors screen will display all the sounds that were marked as “incorrect” in red circles and “approximate” in yellow circles. Each incorrect/approximate error is reported based on sound position and age of acquisition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the left is the overall percentage for sound errors marked in the initial, medial, and final positions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>As SLPs, we are all familiar with standardized and non-standardized measures for assessing speech sound disorders. But did you know it’s actually not always a requirement for a standardized measure of articulation and phonology to be used in order to diagnose a speech sound disorder and/or determine eligibility in both public school settings and private practice? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, research supports the following: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote {""style"":{""elements"":{""link"":{""color"":{""text"":""var:preset|color|black""}}}},""textColor"":""black""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color""><blockquote><p><strong>“Speech-language pathologists who increase their use of criterion-referenced measures and decrease their use of standardized tests will arrive at more accurate diagnoses of speech sound disorders”.</strong></p><cite><a href=""https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2018_PERS-SIG1-2018-0018#bib20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" title="""">-Kirk &amp; Vigeland, 2014</a></cite></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, the majority of standardized tests of articulation and phonology do not meet basic psychometric requirements (<a href=""https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2018_PERS-SIG1-2018-0018#bib20"">Kirk &amp; Vigeland, 2014</a>), so it is therefore essential that standardized measures not act as the cornerstone of speech sound assessment. This is where criterion referenced measures like <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-test-center-hive-for-ipad-iphone-mac/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" title="""">Articulation Test Center Hive</a> come in…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Criterion-referenced testing uses published criteria from studies on child phonological development for comparison. Criterion-referenced measures are a less utilized, but highly informative, way to evaluate a child’s speech. These measures are proven to provide information that is <em>more </em>reflective of a child's speech skills, supporting the SLP in accurate diagnosis of speech sound disorders.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2018_PERS-SIG1-2018-0018#bib20"">Kirk &amp; Vigeland, 2014</a>, the proven components of a thorough assessment for speech sound disorders include:</p>

Service Delivery for School SLPs,service-delivery-for-school-slps,Little Bee,2024-03-11,Articulation Station Hive,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/atc_blog_header_service_delivery.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/main_service_delivery-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3029"" />

Service delivery for speech sound disorders in the school setting can be complicated… you’re juggling caseload numbers, students missing classroom time, coordinating group goals, maintaining group attention, and timing between grade levels, etc.

The traditional service delivery model that school-based Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) have grown accustomed to is typically 1 or 2 times per week for 30 minutes in a small group. However, many SLPs have begun to shift from this traditional service delivery model to one in which the sessions are individualized and more frequent, but shorter in duration. This change is getting rave reviews from the SLPs who are implementing it.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2910"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5_stars2.png"" alt="""" width=""750"" height=""376"" />

These SLPs have shared that not only has their scheduling burden lessened, they are able to target more in an individual setting (1:1 sessions) as opposed to a group. As a result, they’re seeing their students progressing beautifully toward their therapy goals. Of course, we love to hear from fellow SLPs that something is working… but we also all know that our decisions as professionals should be data-driven. So, here’s the best part… these service delivery changes are also backed by research!

<a title=""The Informed SLP"" href=""https://www.theinformedslp.com/reviews"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Informed SLP</a> shared a study by <a title=""Byers et. al."" href=""https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2020_LSHSS-20-00057"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Byers et. al.</a> that looked at the differences between a “business as usual” approach and one where students were seen for short, but more frequent individual sessions. They found that for students with mild–moderate speech sound disorders, short but more frequent individual sessions led to similar gains compared with “business as usual” sessions.

This is great news for your mild to moderate caseload! <strong>As long as you’re providing high levels of therapeutic support (cues, models, etc) and you’re fitting in a high number of production trials into those sessions, your students can make the same improvements with less time out of the classroom.</strong> And you, their SLP, can spend 1:1 time with each student as opposed to always juggling the dynamics of a group.

<strong>If you’re intrigued by this shift… you’re in the right place! As a Little Bee Hive member, you’ll have everything you need to implement this model.</strong>

You can monitor progress, and screen and assess speech sound disorders with <a title=""Articulation Test Center Hive"" href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-test-center-hive-for-ipad-iphone-mac/"">Articulation Test Center Hive</a>. You’ll also have every phoneme target (consonants and vowels) at every level (isolation to conversation) on your iPad with <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" title=""Articulation Station Hive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>. With both of these comprehensive tools, you can implement this model with absolute ease! No bags of materials, sorting through flashcards or worksheets. No clipboards or even pens needed to track data. It’s all there for you.

<strong><font size=""+2"">How to get started</font></strong>
Here’s how to start shifting your service model for speech sound disorders in the school setting…

<strong>1. State your case to your district or site administrator</strong> about your plan to make a change. Show them the studies that back up this model, and be clear on how all parties (student, SLP, teachers, etc.) would benefit. Be sure to highlight how with this approach, you are able to maximize time in the general education classroom while also providing quality, individualized and intensive therapy to address each child’s unique needs.

<strong>2. Look at your speech schedule</strong> to figure out logistically how this would work. Would you move to 10 minute 1:1 sessions, 3 times per week? Or would you move to 5 minute 1:1 sessions 3 or 4 times per week? Look at the needs of your students and what works best. It’s up to you!

<strong>3. Look at your caseload</strong> and see which students with mild to moderate speech sound disorders would be a good candidate for the shift.

<strong>4. Get informed consent</strong> from the parents/caregivers of the child and document the change in services through an IEP. Discuss the benefits with the parents and document those benefits in the IEP notes as well. Some SLPs choose to just start this new model as new students are added to the caseload and as annual IEPs come up for current students, versus holding addendum IEPs… whatever works best- you’re the expert.

The use of technology can be controversial in the educational and parenting spaces, especially when it comes to screen time. As a company that makes educational software, we think it is important to have open discussions about when it is and isn't beneficial to use technology with our children. After all, not all screen time is created equal!

As experts in child development our philosophy is that television programs, apps, YouTube videos, or video games are never a substitute for skilled and individualized assessment or therapy. However, when licensed professionals can use technology as an intentional therapeutic tool that saves them time, makes them more efficient, and is more engaging for the children they serve, everybody wins!

When considering what type of technology is appropriate to use in therapy, how do you determine what is “good” and what should be limited or avoided? In a review of multiple studies on screen time and child development, the <a href=""https://www.theinformedslp.com/review/it-s-time-to-talk-screen-time"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Informed SLP</a> found there are two main things to consider, context and content.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Screen Time Considerations</font></strong>

<strong>CONTEXT</strong>

When deciding on appropriate technology use, the context must be considered. Look at the context and ask:

1. How is the child engaging with the media?
2. Who is the child with?
3. Is this screen time activity replacing something that is more beneficial?

<strong>CONTENT</strong>

When deciding on appropriate technology use, the content must also be considered. Look at the content and ask:

1. How “busy” is it? Is it auditorily or visually overstimulating?
2. Who makes it and is profiting from it?
3. Does it model strategies for caregivers?
4. What is the child learning?

At Little Bee Speech, we are proud to say that our expertly designed and intuitive software checks all the boxes for “good tech”. Parents and SLPs can set aside their concerns about adding more screen time to a child’s daily routine when they use any of our Little Bee Speech software tools. They can feel confident knowing that our programs are developed with context and content in mind.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Little Bee Speech Software: Consider the <em><span style=""color: #f99903;"">Context</font></strong></em>

<em><strong>How is the child engaging with the media?</strong></em>

The child engages with <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a> as a part of a therapeutic program, with goals specific to their unique needs. When engaging with <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-test-center-hive-for-ipad-iphone-mac/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Test Center Hive</a> the child is either participating in a comprehensive assessment of their speech sound production to develop a therapeutic program or to check-in on their progress toward their therapy goals.

<em><strong>Who is the child with?</strong></em>

When using these Little Bee Speech software tools, the child is partnered with a speech-language pathologist, speech-language pathology assistant or a parent/caregiver (under the guidance of an SLP).

<em><strong>Is this screen time activity replacing something that is more beneficial?</strong></em>

The focus of the apps in the Little Bee Hive membership (Articulation Test Center Hive and Articulation Station Hive) is to support the child’s speech production skills and to set the SLP or parent up for success when they are working with the child. When it comes to beneficial activities, it doesn’t get much more beneficial than that!

<strong><font size=""+2"">Little Bee Speech Software: Consider the <em><span style=""color: #f99903;"">Content</font></strong></em>

<em><strong>How “busy” is it? Is it auditorily or visually overstimulating?</strong></em>

The apps in our Little Bee Hive Membership have clear, real-life images, animated illustrations and simple activities that are engaging but not overstimulating.

In Articulation Station Hive, the child is provided with comprehensive yet simple activities to support the production of all consonants and vowels from the isolation level to conversational level. For example, in our rotating sentence activity, the child is able to interact with the sentence features by pushing the “spin” button, but the focus is still on sound production.

In Articulation Test Center Hive, the clear images and speech sample illustrations are designed to sustain a child’s attention and interest, while still achieving the goal of obtaining a sample of speech production at the single word level and in connected speech.

<em><strong>Who makes it and is profiting from it?</strong></em>

Little Bee Speech software is meticulously designed by licensed and certified speech-language pathologists. We aim to provide fellow speech-language pathologists with thoughtful tools that help them do their job more efficiently and effectively. We use the most up-to-date research and our own clinical expertise to provide SLPs with everything they need to assess and treat speech sound disorders all in one place at an affordable price.

In addition to being SLPs we are also parents. We recognize the importance of teaching and working patiently with our little learners to help them achieve their communication potential. Using effective tools like Articulation Station Hive and Articulation Test Center Hive can make a world of difference for us and them as we help them on their speech journey.

<em><strong>Does it model strategies for caregivers? What is the child learning?</strong></em>

In Articulation Station Hive, we provide built-in strategies for SLPs and parents to support successful sound production. For example, every vowel and consonant has an accompanying picture, hand and letter cue. Every phoneme has a detailed information page filled with these cues, production/placement details, scripts and visuals.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/content_context_5.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""705"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3149"" />

In Articulation Test Center Hive, the detailed data analysis and results support the SLP in making treatment decisions. The results are also easily shareable with parents to support their involvement and understanding of the therapeutic program. A full written report is generated and recommendations for practice are given.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Not all technology is created equal.</font></strong>

Screen time and the use of technology with children should be scrutinized and assessed. Parents and service providers should always consider the context and content when deciding if the use of screens is “okay”. When used as a therapeutic tool, there are wonderful benefits to technology. 

Parents and SLPs can feel confident when using Little Bee Speech software tools, knowing that they are professionally designed by SLPs to optimize engagement, efficiency, and the use of evidence-based therapy strategies for treating and assessing speech sound disorders.

Multimodal Cueing For Speech Sound Disorders,multimodal-cueing-for-speech-sound-disorders,Little Bee,2024-03-22,Articulation,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/hand_cue_01.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/main_multimodal_cueing.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3026"" />

As SLPs, we pride ourselves on our ability to scaffold in order to best support the children we work with. We facilitate learning by meeting the child where they’re at, providing support and then gradually withdrawing that support until the child can perform the task independently.  This is based on Vgotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development. <strong>One of the most significant ways we scaffold and support a child’s progress with speech sound disorders is through multimodal cueing.</strong>
 
Multimodal cues are cues that involve more than one learning modality. Cues can be visual or verbal, gestural or tactile, letter cues or metacognitive cues. The cues are often used in combination with each other and depend on the child’s unique needs.

We’ve all experienced those magical moments in therapy when the appropriate support results in a child connecting all the dots and successfully producing their target sound. Not only does our clinical experience show us that it works… research supports the use of multimodal cueing too! Research has shown that multimodal cueing offers several benefits in speech therapy for young children. When we provide children with multimodal cues, it increases their awareness and improves their production of targeted speech sounds.
<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2907"" src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/spacer.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""6"" />
 
<strong><font size=""+2"">Benefits of multimodal cueing:</font></strong>

<strong>1. Enhances sensory feedback, providing children with a clearer understanding of how to produce specific speech sounds:</strong>

When visual cues such as pictures or videos are provided, it offers a visual reference for correct articulatory placement. Familiarity with picture representations and discussion of how sounds are produced also act as metacognitive cues for children. Tactile cues, such as hand movements or touch cues, provide physical guidance for correct articulation. Letter cues allow the child to associate speech sounds with corresponding letters to reinforce phonemic awareness and literacy skills.

<strong>2. Accommodates diverse learning styles and preferences:</strong>

While some children may respond better to visual cues, others may benefit more from tactile or auditory cues. By offering a variety of cues, therapists can tailor interventions to suit individual needs, maximizing the effectiveness of therapy sessions.

<strong>3. Promotes generalization of skills beyond the therapy setting:</strong>

By engaging multiple sensory modalities, children develop a more robust understanding of speech sounds, facilitating transfer of learned skills to real-life communication situations. Bonus- if the child’s caregivers are provided with guidance on the cues used in therapy, they can also support that carryover at home!

You may be wondering where to start. You may already be providing these types of cues during therapy but it may be hard to quantify what you’re doing or you may be finding it difficult to provide the same cueing across sessions.  Thankfully, our comprehensive therapy app, <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" title=""Articulation Station Hive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>, has you covered. 

Articulation Station Hive has built-in multimodal cues for every consonant and vowel sound, including:

<strong>Tactile/Hand Cues:</strong> Physical prompts and gestures are provided for every sound to guide correct articulatory movements. For example, the hand cue for /k/ shows a flat hand next to the mouth- the hand pulls backward as the sound is produced to indicate tongue positioning needed for sound production.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hand_cue_01.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""609"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3037"" />

<strong>Picture Cues:</strong> Visual, interactive and kid-friendly representations are available as tools and within activities. These picture cues for each phoneme aid in articulatory placement and sound discrimination. For example, the picture cue for the phoneme /b/, The Bubble Sound, is an illustration of a blowfish holding and then blowing bubbles.

<strong>Letter Cues:</strong> Associating speech sounds with corresponding letters to reinforce phonemic awareness and literacy skills. For example, a child working on the phoneme /p/ will be provided with the letter ""p"" to tap and find.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/letter_cue_01.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""625"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-2988"" />

<strong>Metacognitive Cues:</strong> Detailed descriptions for how to produce each sound as well as names for each phoneme act as cognitive reference points, which enhance self-awareness and monitoring of speech production. For example, when working on /h/ with a child, you can simply say, “That’s the hot sound” and the child will be cued to their reference of the picture cue for Hot Hobbes, the panting puppy, who represents the /h/ phoneme.

<strong>By integrating multimodal cues seamlessly into therapy sessions, the children you work with will receive evidence-based support, tailored to their individual needs.</strong> 

If you’re looking for a way to provide multimodal cueing without all the prep, then Articulation Station Hive is what you need. With built-in multimodal cues for every consonant and vowel sound at your fingertips you'll be set up for success when working on these sounds in isolation.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Partnering with Parents in Therapy</font></strong>

Parents and Speech-Language Pathologists have the same ultimate goal- to support the child’s ability to grow and thrive, in the therapy room and beyond. So, it isn’t surprising that research studies have shown that when parents and SLPs work together, children make significantly more progress towards their therapy goals.

However, we know it isn’t something that happens automatically. Both SLPs and parents bring their own perspectives (and sometimes biases) into these therapeutic relationships… so having a successful and collaborative partnership has to be intentional, on both ends.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Parent perspective</font></strong>

Parents are often entering the therapy process with a lot on their mind. They may be navigating a new diagnosis or they may have had negative experiences with other therapists or evaluators. Parents may feel overwhelmed. They may be unsure what their child needs and how to best support them.

<strong><font size=""+1"">SLP Perspective</font></strong>

Very often, SLPs have a lot on their plate, regardless of the setting they work in. They have systems they’ve put in place to manage their workload and often stick to those systems, but they may not be the most conducive to collaboration. Although SLPs of course see and know the value in partnering with parents, it often can be difficult to truly implement.

<strong><font size=""+1"">How to foster a successful partnership?</font></strong>

We’ve put together a list of practical ways for both parents and SLPs to foster a successful and collaborative partnership to improve therapeutic outcomes:

<strong><font size=""+1"">As a parent, when therapy begins:</font></strong>

1. Share your concerns about your child’s communication skills.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">What do you see impacting them the most? What do you hope to see as a result of therapy?</p>

2. Provide information &amp; documents.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">Give the SLP any previous reports or documents related to your child’s needs and services.</p>

3. Ask for information about the SLP’s experience and therapy approach.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">What areas do they specialize in and how much experience do they have working with other children who present with needs similar to your child’s? What is their philosophy and therapy approach? What do their therapy sessions typically look like?</p>

4. Share information about your child’s preferences to set the SLP (and your child) up for success.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">What are they motivated by? When do you see them most engaged? From your perspective, what do you think would make therapy sessions successful?</p>

5. Ask all the questions!

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">SLPs want you to ask questions. There are no silly questions!</p>

6. Express your interest in being involved and carrying over tasks at home.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">Parent involvement in sessions may vary depending on the setting, but it can’t hurt to ask how you can be involved and how to best support the carryover of the targeted skills at home.</p>

7. If something isn’t working- talk about it.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">You are your child’s best advocate. If something isn’t working, get clarification from the SLP and if needed, ask for changes.

<strong><font size=""+1"">As an SLP, when a therapy relationship begins with a child &amp; family:</font></strong>

1. Include the parent from the start by asking for their input.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">What do they see as their child’s strengths and needs? What differences do they hope to see as their child progresses? Gathering this information helps parents feel like they are a part of the process and can help you as the SLP understand the child’s needs from their perspective.</p>

2. Explain what therapy will look like and why.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">This is important to building authority and trust as well as helping parents see why you’re doing what you’re doing. It helps make them a partner in the process. This also includes setting expectations of progress and how communication with you will look.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">For example, when reviewing the child’s goals, you’ll discuss what the goals are, how they will be measured and when you may expect each goal to be met. You’ll share specific ways you’ll target this goal in therapy and why.</p>

3. Involve the parent in therapy sessions and have open communication.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">If you’re an SLP that works in-home, in an outpatient clinic or private practice</strong>... this is a little easier. Have the parent sit in during or at the end of the session so you can model and explain to them what you’re doing.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">If you’re an SLP in the school setting</strong>... this can be a little more difficult. Try to have an open email policy and an easy way to update parents on their child’s progress. This may look like creating an email template you can use and adjust for emailing once a month or developing a regular sticky note that gets sent home after sessions about what was worked on. Don’t let an annual IEP be the only time you’ve communicated.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">If you are an SLP that is using <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" title=""Articulation Station Hive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a></strong>... we’ve made the communication part easier for you. You can easily send data, notes and audio recordings from sessions directly to parents using email or the other sharing options available.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">a.  Open the scores screen inside Articulation Station Hive and tap the Share button</p>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shares_scores_01.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""459"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3381"" />

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">b.  Select a sharing option on the pop up sheet.</p>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shares_scores_02.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""459"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3381"" />

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">c.  If you select email, simply add the recipient's email address and tap the blue send button. Tip: If the email is already added in the student profile it will populate here automatically.</p>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shares_scores_03.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""459"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3381"" />

4. Provide the parent with practical ways they can carryover their child’s therapy targets at home.

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">Consider their family’s unique needs and ask what kind of time they can dedicate to carrying over skills. Ideally, your suggestions would be something they can realistically implement on a day-to-day basis without adding more to their already full plate.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">If you’re an SLP who is using Articulation Station Hive in therapy and parents have expressed interest in carrying over the use of Articulation Station Hive at home, we have good news...</p>

<p style=""margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;"">We have a parent version of Articulation Station Hive. The parent tier pricing and details are below. Feel free to share with any parents that may be interested!</p>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/high_five.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""459"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3440"" />

<strong><font size=""+1"">When we work together everyone wins!</font></strong>

When parents and SLPs can collaborate and have a meaningful partnership, the child can be more holistically supported, and their therapy outcomes improve.

When parents gain information and insight into what their child is working on and why, research shows they will play a more active role in therapy, feel more connected to their child and overall feel more confident in executing strategies.

When the SLP incorporates the parent’s perspective and insight, they may find new ways to motivate or connect with a child or discover a more effective system for targeting goals in therapy. The SLP will also be able to use what they’ve learned about the family’s routines, cultural factors, and existing systems to make recommendations for at-home practice.

<strong><font size=""+2"">What Little Bee Hive members are saying…</font></strong>

<em>“Give Yourself the Gift of Time! Gone are the days of fumbling through card decks to sort targets by positions and phonological process while clients wait impatiently. Articulation Station Hive has solved this and many of the other time consuming problems! I use this app religiously in my private practice for discriminating minimal pairs; engaging syllable/ word/ phrase/ sentence/ story level stimuli; recording clients; collecting data; and motor movement practicing via syllable sliders. It not only benefits me, but also engages clients of all ages because it’s incredibly interactive. I love that I can spend more time practicing and less time prepping, organizing, setting up, and packing away materials.”</em>
<strong>-Nanette C. (SLP)</strong>

<em>“This is my 24th year as an SLP and this app totally made me better overnight. The new features of being able to target vowels, minimal pairs, and sounds at the syllable level make planning and providing therapy so much easier! I also love the ability to choose words, improvements to the matching game, and the variety of sentences. The aspect I love the most is the amazing data graphs. I have students in kindergarten through sixth grade ask to see their data. When I go to write progress reports, all I need is my iPad and I am able to quickly see the data along with any notes I have taken. This has made me a better therapist and saved me time. I can’t wait to see what additional features they add.”</em>
<strong>-Bobbi M. (SLP)</strong>

<em>“Best money I have spent in 5 years of being an independent practitioner. It has saved me so much time planning, printing, cutting, laminating and lugging so much stuff from school to school. I love the fact that I can target sounds with syllables and go right up to sentences and stories, even incorporating conversion and questioning. Having it all there at a touch of a button means I get to spend more time with each child and can still incorporate some other games into our sessions too. The kids love it as they think they are in control! Love it, thank you!”</em>
<strong>-Ginny T. (SLP)</strong>

<em>“Articulation Station Hive has everything I never knew I was missing! It offers the ability to work at every level, from isolation to conversation. The animated pictures representing various sounds are engaging and memorable (and did I mention they are animated?!?) At the syllable level, sliders give you the opportunity to walk your students through the sound blending process. New pictures and target words have been added as well as a fun new spinner sentences. One of my favorite new features is the conversation level. Beautiful picture scenes are offered with a ton of clickable pictures to give additional conversation starters. Another choice at the conversational level is an array of interesting questions such as “would you rather?” and “have you ever?” sets. For your students with phonological processes, this app has you covered because there are a ton of minimal pairs. For score reporting, there are new graph features. And as if all of this is not enough, Hive throws in a fun little extra and offers you the ability to change the app background with seasonal and holiday backgrounds. If you treat kids (older or younger) with speech sound disorders, this app is a must have. I wouldn’t SLP without it!”</em>
<strong>-Cindy C. (SLP)</strong>

<em>“I have been using Articulation Station Hive for a few months now and I must say that I love the new updates and additions that have been added! The minimal pairs are a HUGE hit with my kiddos. They also really enjoy the isolation and syllable features, including the hand and picture cues as well as the sliders and spinners. We love customizing the home screen theme to fit all major holidays and fun occasions. They also love using the picture scenes for language goals as well as conversational activities for carryover and generalization. We LOVE the Hive! 10/10 from us!”</em>

<strong><font size=""+2"">Thriving (not just surviving) in SLP Graduate School</font></strong>

The SLP grad school experience is a complex journey. You will dive deep into complicated topics while honing your clinical skills across an incredibly wide scope of practice. You will have to navigate feedback from supervisors that can range from positive to critical. You will likely experience a mix of emotions—overwhelm, anxiety, uncertainty, and a bit of imposter syndrome—alongside excitement, curiosity, and pride for all you have accomplished.

It's a lot! You may often feel like you are just surviving. But, nobody wants to just survive! This experience is the foundation for your lifelong career. 

Here are some tips for making your graduate school experience as an SLP a positive one, from a few seasoned SLPs (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/speakingofsamantics/"" title=""Speaking of Samantics Instagram"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">@speakingofsamantics</a> and the SLPs at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/littlebeespeech/"" title=""Little Bee Speech Instagram"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">@littlebeespeech</a>). Because you deserve to thrive, not just survive, SLP grad school!

<strong><font size=""+1"">Tip 1: Find Your People</font></strong>

Entering your grad program without familiar faces by your side can feel daunting. Take this opportunity to get to know your classmates and build relationships with those you connect with. It’s okay if it doesn’t happen right away- building relationships takes time, but it’s well worth the effort. Strong relationships with classmates will not only benefit your academic success through study groups, collaboration, and material sharing, but the friendships you form will be monumental to your ability to thrive in both grad school and in your future career.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Tip 2: Understand What Type of Learner You Are</font></strong>

Everyone learns differently. It is easy to get down on yourself if a traditional teaching style or your professor’s teaching style does not align with how you learn. Take some time to figure out what type of learner you are to maximize your graduate school experience.

Consider the following:

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• How do you enjoy learning new information?
• What helps you retain information?
• Do you benefit from reviewing notes or drawing pictures?
• Does summarizing what you have learned or making flashcards help you?</p>

<strong>Chelsea from Little Bee Speech shares:</strong> 

<em>""I found that I really needed to take notes in class and/or follow along with PowerPoints. Audio-only information was difficult for me to retain. I learned a lot through rewriting notes from classes and making them into flashcards. Just the process of writing things down helped me remember more. I also discovered that discussing things with others helped me retain information once I had some base knowledge.""</em>

<strong>Sam from Speaking of Samantics says:</strong> 

<em>""I put myself down test grade after test grade, not realizing that I wasn't supporting my own learning. I am a multimodal learner through and through. I need pictures, videos, text, and summarizing. When I started doing those things for myself, I realized things were clicking so much easier. Give yourself the opportunity to learn in the best way for you. Watch YouTube videos of muscles. Create study sheets with pictures. Use a whiteboard or an iPad to doodle your own drawings.""</em>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Tip 3: It’s Okay if You Don’t Know—Ask Questions and Ask for Help</font></strong>

No one expects you to know everything! Your qualifications and dedication have brought you to this program, but there is so much to learn, and you can’t possibly know it all. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, get clarification, or ask for help. It’s okay to reach out to your professor after class if you don’t understand a topic. It's okay to ask what your clinical supervisor thinks of the strategies you used in your therapy session. This is the time to ask those questions, and they are always welcome.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Tip 4: Utilize the Little Bee Hive University Program from Little Bee Speech</font></strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Tip 5: Purchase Cloud-Based Storage</font></strong>

This will be incredibly helpful while you are in school and throughout your career! When purchasing cloud-based storage, use your personal email (since school emails disappear after graduation). 

There are many options when it comes to cloud-based storage. Some solid, popular options include:

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Google Drive</strong> (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Web) <a href=""https://www.google.com/drive/"" title=""Google Drive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Learn more</a>
• <strong>iCloud</strong> (Mac, Windows, iOS, Web) <a href=""https://www.apple.com/icloud/"" title=""iCloud"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Learn more</a>
• <strong>Dropbox</strong> (Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Web) <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com"" title=""Dropbox"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Learn more</a></p>

Do a little research on what will work best for you and go with it. 

In your cloud-based storage create two main folders: 
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;""><strong>1. Clinic</strong>
<strong>2. Class</strong></p>

Within those main folders, make subfolders for topics like:
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• articulation
• phonology
• executive function
• research, etc.</p>

This will help you keep everything organized and build a toolbox of resources.

Remember, SLP graduate school is about more than just surviving—it is about growing and learning. Keep a positive perspective, find your people, understand how you learn best, take advantage of tools and resources, and stay organized. You are stronger and more capable than you realize. Trust the process, take it one step at a time, and soon you will be amazed at how far you have come. 

You've got this!

Taking Notes in Therapy,taking-notes-in-therapy,Little Bee,2024-07-11,Articulation Station Hive,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/main_notes.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/main_notes-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3564"" />

<strong><font size=""+2"">Efficient and accurate note-taking is essential for tracking a child’s progress in speech therapy sessions, and in planning future therapy sessions.</font></strong> 

The ability to clearly document observations, student progress, and therapy plans can make a significant difference in the quality of care you provide. But even with our best intentions, we often end up with disorganized notes consisting of sporadic thoughts and scores that can be time consuming to organize. 

We know the struggle all too well! So, we'd like to share some practical tips for taking meaningful notes in therapy sessions, as well as tips for using the notes feature in Articulation Station Hive that will help you stay organized, and be better prepared for therapy sessions and IEPs.

If you use Articulation Station Classic, or <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a> you’re likely familiar with the audio recordings and scoring button features they offer, but don’t forget to utilize the note taking feature as well!

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ipad_note_icon-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""550"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3579"" />

You can easily take individualized notes in Articulation Station Hive by tapping the small pencil button below the recording button, on the bottom left corner of the screen. The notes are then saved for that activity and accessible in the student’s profile to use for planning the next session, progress reports, IEPs, etc.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/soap_notes-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""325"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3570"" />

When utilizing the notes section, just take it back to the basics. Document as much or as little as you’d like, and use the SOAP acronym to guide you! Here’s a quick review:

<strong><font size=""+1"">S - Subjective:</font></strong> 
Jot down your observations, or information you receive from caregivers. For example, you may note if the child entered the therapy session with ease or if they demonstrated frustration as they completed tasks.

<strong><font size=""+1"">O - Objective:</font></strong>
This is where you track the accuracy of a student’s speech productions. The recording and scoring features in Articulation Station Hive make this easy. Simply press record, score the student's productions as correct, incorrect, or approximate, and save your scores to track progress, and review in IEP meetings. If you, or the little fingers of your student, score something by mistake you can always tap the overall score in the upper right corner to undo the last score. This helps keep your data accurate.

<strong><font size=""+1"">A - Assessment:</font></strong>
Note how the session went and what progress you observed. You may note the level of prompting required, for example, “moderate tactile cues/hand prompts were needed throughout the session” or “ they were most successful after an initial model”. In the minimal pairs activity you may note whether you were working on auditory discrimination, or on speech production. Anything else you observe during the session can be described here as well. For example, you can describe nasal air emissions exhibited or tongue placement differences. 

<strong><font size=""+1"">P - Plan:</font></strong>
Outline your plan and potential targets for the next session. For example, you could note: “Ruby did very well at the phrase level today. Ready to move to rotating sentences next week.”

Effective note-taking and data management are cornerstones of successful therapy. With <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"">Articulation Station Hive</a>, you can streamline these processes, ensuring that your records are accurate, accessible, and easy to update.

Strategies for School SLPs: Caseload & Scheduling,strategies-for-school-slps-caseload-scheduling,Little Bee,2024-07-26,Caseload,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/main_scheduling.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/main_scheduling-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3608"" />

<strong>(Part 1 in our School SLP Series)</strong>

Whether you’re a veteran Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) or this will be your first school year in the role, starting the school year with a well-organized caseload and schedule is crucial. Here are the 5 things you should do first to ensure your school year gets off to a smooth and efficient start:

<strong><font size=""+1"">1. Review Caseload List and IEP Goals/Services</font></strong>
Begin by thoroughly reviewing your caseload list along with each student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals and services. You'll be using these details to help you create an effective and efficient schedule.

<strong><font size=""+1"">2. Review Class Lists and Group Students by Area of Need and Grade/Class</font></strong>
Examine class lists and try to group students by their specific areas of need as well as their grade or class. This organization will help streamline your therapy sessions and make your schedule more manageable.

<strong><font size=""+1"">3. Review School Day Schedule and Contact Teachers</font></strong>
Familiarize yourself with the school day schedule for each grade level and reach out to teachers to understand their special activity schedules (library, computer time, PE, etc.). Keep these schedules handy to refer to throughout the year to avoid scheduling conflicts.

<strong><font size=""+1"">4. Create a First Draft Schedule and Review with Teachers </font></strong>
Develop a preliminary schedule and discuss it with teachers. Some SLPs find the whiteboard and post-it note method effective, while others prefer paper and pen. A digital version (like using Google sheets or Google Docs) is often best for easy editing. If a scheduled time isn't ideal, provide teachers with second and third options, but avoid letting them choose their own times unless there's a significant need or conflict… it will likely be very difficult to accommodate everyone perfectly.

<strong><font size=""+1"">5. Schedule Time for Yourself </font></strong>
Don’t forget to include time in your schedule for essential tasks like testing and report writing. Also, consider when IEP meetings are typically held and block off time for those IEPs during your school day. If you collaborate with your IEP team regularly via staff meetings, factor in this time as well.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/scheduling_quote-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""335"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3604"" />

The most important thing to remember when it comes to your caseload and scheduling is… STAY FLEXIBLE. Your schedule will inevitably change numerous times throughout the year due to various factors such as group dynamics, students' evolving needs, changes in your caseload, special events, and teachers' schedules. Always be prepared to adjust your service delivery model to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. For example, providing therapy for speech sound disorders in a non-traditional manner can be highly effective, as we discussed in our blog post, <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/service-delivery-for-school-slps/"" title=""Service Delivery for School SLPs"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Service Delivery for School SLPs</a>.
 
Starting the school year with a well-organized caseload and schedule is essential for any SLP. By following these strategies, you can ensure a more efficient and productive year, benefiting both you and your students.

<strong>(Part 2 in our School SLP Series)</strong>

Whether you’re a veteran School-Based Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) or this is your first year, organizing group therapy sessions efficiently is essential for success. Here are some practical tips to get your school year off to a great start when it comes to group therapy sessions.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Before the Session</font></strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">1. Schedule and Group Students with Intention</font></strong>

Group students by age/grade and goals. Ideally, place kids from the same class together if they have similar goals and needs. This makes scheduling easier because they will have the same schedules to work around (e.g., library time, PE, etc.). If something comes up with that particular teacher’s schedule, it will impact the entire group simultaneously.

See our first post in our School SLP Series, <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/strategies-for-school-slps-caseload-scheduling/"" title=""Strategies for School SLPs: Caseload and Scheduling"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strategies for School SLPs: Caseload and Scheduling</a> for more details on how to organize your schedule and caseload.

<strong><font size=""+1"">2. Utilize No-Prep and Low-Prep Therapy Tools</font></strong>

As a School SLP, your time is very limited, and you have a lot on your plate. Minimizing planning for therapy sessions can help ease your workload. A good therapy session doesn’t have to involve a lot of prep! Utilize low to no-prep options for therapy.

<a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" title=""Articulation Station Hive"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a> is a great example of a “grab and go” resource. It has everything you need to run engaging and effective individual and group therapy sessions with no prep. For group therapy sessions, you can provide targets individualized to each child’s articulation error or phonological process at whatever level they require (from isolation to conversation) without the burden of juggling multiple decks of cards. Switch between each child’s target quickly and easily with just a few taps!

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/groups_01-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3650"" />

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/groups_02-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3651"" />

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/groups_03-1.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3652"" />

<strong><font size=""+1"">3. Figure Out the Logistics</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Plan how to get kids out of class and to their therapy sessions efficiently. For younger children like preschoolers or kindergarteners, you may need to pick them up from class to get them to your therapy room, while older children may be able to walk to your therapy room independently.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Ensure both the teacher and students remember the session times. Every teacher has a different strategy for this. They may write the child’s initials and speech time on their whiteboard or provide the child with a post-it note on their desk. Some teachers may require a phone call reminder every time the child needs to come for the session.</p>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/post_it_note-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3676"" />

<strong><font size=""+2"">During the Session</font></strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">1. Set the Expectations and Routine</font></strong>

Having a routine and a visual schedule for the session can help keep everyone on task. Knowing what to expect is important as it can help reduce anxiety or unwanted negative behaviors.

<strong><font size=""+1"">2. Manage Behavioral Needs</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Review behavior expectations briefly at the start of every session.
• Be mindful of the dynamics within the group. Some children may have difficulty being in the same group due to their needs or behaviors.
• Have go-to strategies in place for managing behaviors if they escalate in the moment.</p>

<strong><font size=""+1"">3. Keep Everyone Engaged</font></strong>

Use tasks that keep everyone busy while you focus on production strategies with individual children. If you are working with young children, or children with a short attention span we suggest you provide your students with a simple activity to do when it is not their turn.

Some ideas include:
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• A simple board game where the child can take their turn after their production tasks
• Sticker or foam crafts where the children receive pieces after every production task/turn
• Coloring sheets with crayons
• Dot marker sheets where the child can make a dot for every production</p>

<strong><font size=""+1"">4. Take Data</font></strong>

Consistent data collection during therapy sessions is crucial for tracking a child’s progress toward their goals. This can be especially challenging in group sessions, where finding the best method can be daunting. Using individual data sheets for each child may seem practical, but managing multiple sheets while eliciting sound production and keeping the group engaged is difficult. A group data sheet simplifies this, but changes in group composition and scheduling throughout the school year can lead to lost data. Additionally, intermingling data sheets in student files poses privacy concerns.

Articulation Station Hive addresses these issues with a simplified, flexible, and streamlined data system. You can mark correct, approximate, and errored productions with a single tap and audio record all the child’s productions. This is just as easy to use for groups as it is for individual sessions. When you’re in group mode, simply tap the child’s name to switch to their individual sound targets and the data you take will be automatically saved to that student’s profile.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/groups_05-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3658"" />

<strong><font size=""+2"">After the Session</font></strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">1. Document and Reflect</font></strong>

Once the group session is over, take a brief moment to write down any additional observations for each child. What did or didn’t work? How did the child respond? This subjective information is incredibly helpful for planning the next session.

For example, you may note: “Harper responded best to tactile cueing, and the prompts used were faded throughout the session” or “James exhibited difficulty getting his tongue tip to the alveolar ridge but improved when provided with a mirror to see his positioning.”

With Articulation Station Hive, you can easily add notes for each child during the session by tapping the pencil icon. Or, you can add notes after the session by selecting their name from the data screen, then selecting the session details, and finally tapping the pencil icon to add notes.
 
See our previous blog post, <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/taking-notes-in-therapy/"" title=""Taking Notes in Therapy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Taking Notes in Therapy</a> for more details.

<strong><font size=""+1"">2. Plan for the Next Session</font></strong>

Take a moment to write a brief note about what you want to work on next time you meet, such as: “Practice rotating sentences for s-blends next week.” This will help save you precious prep time before the next session. If a student needs to continue working at the same level next time you can utilize the  “repeat activity” feature in Articulation Station Hive, which requires no prep! To do this, open the student’s session results from the previous week and tap, ""repeat activity.”

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/groups_08-2.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3673"" />

<strong><font size=""+1"">3. Keep your data organized</font></strong>

Have a system for revisiting your data and therapy notes so they can be easily accessed when it comes time for progress reports and IEPs. There’s nothing worse than sitting down to prepare for an upcoming IEP and not having the data to back up the progress that you know is there. 

With Articulation Station Hive, you can quickly access all the scores, audio recordings and notes from every therapy session for every child. You’ll never be stressed about finding or having consistent therapy data to show your student’s progress. Simply tap on “scores” from the main menu and find the child’s name. All of their sessions will be safely saved there for you!

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/groups_07.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""490"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3654"" />

<strong><font size=""+1"">4. Openly Communicate</font></strong>

Consistently sharing what is being worked on during therapy sessions with the child’s teacher and parent is important for the generalization of skills and maintaining open communication. This way, you’re not discussing the child’s progress for the first time at their annual IEP meeting.
 
Articulation Station Hive facilitates easy sharing of data with teachers and parents. To share session results go to the scores menu, find the child’s name and choose the session you’d like to share, then tap the “share” button to share via text or email.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Other Considerations</font></strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Mixed Group Sessions</font></strong>

Sometimes, you may not have the advantage of having a speech-only therapy group. We have you covered! Our <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/little_stories_pro.php"" title=""Little Stories Pro"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Little Stories Pro</a> app is a comprehensive therapy tool that includes 82 carefully crafted stories that target speech, language and literacy. Depending on the goals of the children in your group, you can use one story throughout the session to target everything from vocabulary and WH concepts to narrative language development and speech sound production.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Adjusting Groups</font></strong>

If your groupings aren’t working, be flexible and consider other options. Don’t stay stuck. Check out our previous posts on <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/service-delivery-for-school-slps/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Service Delivery for School SLPs</a> and <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/strategies-for-school-slps-caseload-scheduling/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Caseload & Scheduling for School SLPs</a> for more ideas.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Handling Rescheduling</font></strong>

It’s inevitable that sessions will have to be rescheduled due to absences or special school events. If a session is missed because of a school event or student absence, you may not be obligated to make it up (consult your specific district and admin if you have questions). Have a plan for rescheduling, such as adding missed students to another group or having a set window each week for make-up sessions if needed.

Starting the school year with a well-organized approach to group therapy sessions can make a significant difference in your efficiency and the effectiveness of your interventions. By following these strategies, you can create a supportive and productive environment for your students.

<strong>(Part 3 in our School SLP Series)</strong>

Whether you’re a veteran Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) or this is your first year as a School-Based SLP, prepping for, running, and managing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) can be a very time-consuming element of your job. Here are some practical tips to get your school year off to a great start when it comes to IEPs:

<strong><font size=""+2"">Before the IEP</font></strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Scheduling</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Review Initials, Triennials (TRIs), and the 60-Day Calendar:</strong> Ensure you have a clear understanding of the timelines and deadlines for each type of IEP.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Coordinate with Staff Availability:</strong> Work with teachers, therapists, and other staff to find a time that works for everyone involved.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Calendar the Meetings:</strong> Use a coordinated online calendar so that everyone needed at the IEP can see it on their schedule far in advance.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Send Out Meeting Notices to Parents:</strong> Give parents ample notice so they can make arrangements to attend.</p>


<strong><font size=""+1"">Testing</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Conduct Required Testing for Initial or Triennial IEPs:</strong> Make sure all necessary assessments are completed. Our comprehensive testing tool, <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-test-center-hive-for-ipad-iphone-mac/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Test Center Hive</a>, can help you streamline testing, analysis and report writing for assessments involving speech sound disorders.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Review Data for Annual IEPs to Report Progress and Develop New Goals/Baselines:</strong> Use parental input, teacher input, informal observations and collected data from therapy sessions to inform new goals. Our comprehensive therapy tool, <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"">Articulation Station Hive</a>, makes it easy to collect data and audio recordings for every session, so you’ll be set up for success when it comes time to report on the child’s progress and develop new goals that are data-driven.</p>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Team Members</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Remind Team Members of the Upcoming IEP:</strong> Although you’ve already coordinated schedules, it is often helpful on the week of the meeting to remind all team members (including the parents).</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Align with Other Team Members on the Child's General Needs:</strong> Collect insights and feedback from teachers and other professionals working with the child to ensure a unified approach to the child’s educational plan.</p>

<strong><font size=""+2"">During the IEP</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Bring Necessary Technology:</strong> Ensure you have all required tech tools on hand, such as your computer for note-taking and referring to the IEP during the meeting and your iPad to review testing results or therapy data records with <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-test-center-hive-for-ipad-iphone-mac/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Test Center Hive</a> and <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Be Prepared to Take Detailed Notes:</strong> Decide on an official note-taker for the meeting. Detailed documentation will ensure that everyone’s perspective is being heard and the notes serve as reminders of what was discussed in the meeting for future reference.</p>
 
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Provide an Agenda for the Meeting:</strong> Sharing a structured outline of the meeting’s flow with the team members and parent helps everyone know what to expect and keeps the meeting on track.</p>

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iep_quote.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""335"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3721"" />

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Lead with the Child's Strengths:</strong> Start the discussion by highlighting the child’s achievements and positive attributes.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Gather Input from Parents and Team Members:</strong> Encourage active participation from all attendees throughout the meeting. Don’t forget that parent input is crucial to the development of the IEP.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Review Progress on Prior Goals:</strong> Discuss the child’s progress toward their previous goals- have they been met, are they making progress toward the goal, or does the goal need to be revised? You can show data records and audio recordings with <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>.</p> 

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Present New Proposed Goals:</strong> Clearly outline new goals, benchmarks and objectives. All team members, including the parents, should be aware of and in agreement with the student’s goals and the strategies being used to meet the goals.</p> 

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Demonstrate and Review How Parents Can Support at Home:</strong> Offer practical advice, and home programs if necessary, for parents to reinforce learning.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Discuss Proposed Services:</strong> The goals drive the decision for the most appropriate services. Review the proposed services with the team - they may be the same as they were previously or you may be proposing a change. Discuss your reasoning for the service level and mode of service delivery. All team members must agree on the proposed services.</p> 

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Confirm Consent and Collect Signatures:</strong> As the meeting closes, you will ask all participants to sign the IEP to confirm their attendance. You will have the parents indicate their level of consent to the goals and services with their signatures as well.</p> 

<strong><font size=""+2"">After the IEP</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Finalize Documents:</strong> Upload documents to your IEP system and be sure to make a copy for yourself and other team members. Don’t forget to provide parents with a copy of the finalized IEP. Put the original copy of the IEP in the appropriate file for safe-keeping.</p>
 
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Adjust Records:</strong> Make any needed updates to scheduling, grouping or to the child’s goals to reflect any changes made during the meeting.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Consistently Collect Data:</strong> Utilize therapy and data collection tools like <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a> to regularly track the child’s progress and to streamline future reporting.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Maintain Open Communication:</strong> As the school year moves forward, keep parents informed and engaged to ensure alignment with their child’s IEP. Don’t let next year’s IEP be the only time you communicate with them.</p>

Starting the school year with clear expectations and a well-organized approach to IEPs can significantly reduce your workload. By following these strategies, you’ll be better equipped to manage your responsibilities effectively.

Strategies for School SLPs: Preventing Burnout,strategies-for-school-slps-preventing-burnout,Little Bee,2024-09-06,Articulation Station Hive,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lbs_marie.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/main_burnout-3.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3778"" />

Burnout among school-based Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) is a significant concern. Whether you're a veteran SLP or this is your first year, starting the school year with a plan for preventing and managing burnout is essential for maintaining your well-being and providing the best possible care to your students.

We’re so excited to have partnered with Marie Muratalla of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thanksmorris/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">@thanksmorris</a>, a dedicated school-based SLP who passionately mentors fellow SLPs to help them achieve a healthy work-life balance. Together, we've crafted a comprehensive guide to share effective strategies for combating burnout, ensuring you have the tools and support needed to thrive throughout the school year.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lbs_marie.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""297"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" />

<strong><font size=""+2"">Understanding Burnout</font></strong>

Burnout is defined as the reduction of a fuel or substance to nothing. For SLPs, it means reaching a point of mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion. Burnout can vary from person to person but typically involves severe fatigue and stress.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Causes of Burnout in School SLPs</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Low Salaries:</strong> According to the <a href=""https://www.asha.org/siteassets/surveys/2022-schools-slp-salaries.pdf"" title=""SLP Annual Salaries and Hourly Wages"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ASHA 2022 School SLP Survey</a>, the median full-time salary for working 9 or 10 months was $69,000, while for 11 or 12 months, it was $80,000.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Demanding Workload with Higher Caseloads:</strong> Some states and districts have no caseload caps, leading to a high number of IEPs and assessments. SLPs often split their time between work sites and manage a wide scope of practice and population, from preschool through high school. Limited time to complete assessments, lesson plans, screen students, hold IEPs, and handle paperwork adds to the pressure.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Lack of Support:</strong> There is often a lack of understanding and respect from staff regarding the SLP’s role, inadequate financial support for materials, and insufficient responses when SLPs request help to manage their workloads.</p>

<strong><font size=""+2"">Research Insights</font></strong>

A <a href=""https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2022_LSHSS-22-00047"" title=""School-Based Speech-Language Pathologists' Stress and Burnout: A Cross-Sectional Survey at the Height of the COVID-19 Pandemic"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2020 study</a> shows that 60% of speech pathologists experience high levels of emotional exhaustion and stress. The perception of their workload manageability was the most significant predictor of reported stress and burnout levels. SLPs in the school setting often feel ineffective and overextended.

<strong><font size=""+2"">Impacts of Burnout</font></strong>

Burnout can severely affect your overall health and the quality of therapy you provide. It leads to:
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Overall fatigue</p>
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• High stress levels</p>
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Mind-body disconnect</p>
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Difficulty with client & family connection</p>
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Difficulty building relationships & collaborating</p>

<strong><font size=""+2"">Strategies to Combat Burnout</font></strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Self-Care:</font></strong>
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Engage in outdoor activities.</p> 
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Build time into your day for rest.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• PLAY! (It’s not just for kids - our brains benefit so much from letting our inner child out. Do something creative, try a new recipe, pick up an outdoor game, play board games, etc.)</p> 
<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/slp_burnout_img.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""452"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3785"" /> 
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Incorporate mindful activities into your daily routines (like breathing exercises or yoga).</p> 
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Consider starting a gratitude journal as a helpful way to bring more mindfulness and presence into your daily routine. Gratitude journals like Marie’s <a href=""https://www.thanksmorris.com/shop"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Say Thanks More Journal</a> have been shown to lower cortisol levels and strengthen the mind-body connection.</p> 

<strong><font size=""+1"">Identify Control:</font></strong>
<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">Recognize what you can and cannot control. Focus on aspects you can manage, such as paperwork time, prep time, and schedule flexibility.</p> 

<strong><font size=""+1"">Set and Hold Boundaries:</font></strong>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Personal Boundaries: Limit after-work hours, avoid taking work home, and refrain from working on weekends.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• Professional Boundaries: Educate staff on your needs, say no when necessary, and advocate for both your needs and those of your students.</p>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Ask for Help:</font></strong>
If you are unable to perform your job effectively with the resources provided, seek assistance and advocate for your school site with your administration. There are many online resources available to you via School Based SLP Facebook Groups, SLP advocates in the Instagram world and through your state licensing board or <a href=""https://www.asha.org"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ASHA</a>.
 
For example, many School SLPs are frustrated due to the therapy spaces they are often provided being inadequate for providing services. A quick google search reveals an <a href=""https://www.asha.org/policy/tr2002-00236/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1e9ukz8xmssgvI6fUjLlSNIyvFftYIpwziKKGGHgmMcJJCHcaAipLx67c_aem_AlEebs-BJe5p1F5EKuPeTA#sec1.5.1"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ASHA article</a> about this exact issue and how to make a case for appropriate support.

Remember- you are your own best advocate! Don’t be afraid to express your concerns and ask for what you need. It helps when you have data to back you up, too!

<strong><font size=""+1"">Adjust Service Delivery:</font></strong>

Consider adjusting how you’re providing school-based services and how you can be more flexible with your therapy schedule. Refer to our previous post on <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/service-delivery-for-school-slps/"" title=""Service Delivery for School SLPs"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Service Delivery for School SLPs</a> for detailed strategies.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Utilize Low to No Prep Resources:</font></strong>

You don’t have to sacrifice hours of time for quality assessments or therapy sessions. Use resources that streamline your work and reduce prep time.

<strong>Articulation Test Center Hive</strong> and <strong>Articulation Station Hive</strong> are NO PREP, SLP-designed, evidence-based tools for the assessment and treatment of speech sound disorders. Both tools are included in our <a href=""https://little-bee-speech-tutorials-and-faqs.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-little-bee-hive-membership"" title=""Little Bee Hive Membership"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Little Bee Hive Membership</a>.

(Part 1 in our Speech Sound Disorder Series)

<strong><font size=""+2"">Understanding Speech Sound Disorders:</font></strong>
<strong><font size=""+1"">A Comprehensive Guide for SLPs</font></strong>

As a speech-language pathologist (SLP), you're well-acquainted with the complexities of assessing and treating speech sound disorders (SSDs). These disorders occur when individuals have difficulty producing speech sounds correctly, impacting their ability to communicate effectively. However, ""Speech Sound Disorder"" is an umbrella term that covers a broad spectrum of speech production challenges. As SLPs, it's our responsibility to recognize these nuances, deliver accurate diagnoses, and provide evidence-based treatments tailored to each child's unique needs.

We know how overwhelming the complexity of SSDs can feel at times. That’s exactly why we’ve developed this Speech Sound Disorder Blog Series. In this first post, we’ll break down the different types of SSDs and highlight the importance of early diagnosis. Future posts will delve deeper into each disorder, offering you comprehensive guidance on diagnosis and evidence-based treatment approaches.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Types of Speech Sound Disorders</font></strong>

According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), a Speech Sound Disorder is any difficulty or combination of difficulties with perceiving, producing, or understanding speech sounds. These disorders are generally divided into two categories: <strong>organic and functional.</strong>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Organic Speech Sound Disorders</font></strong>

These disorders are caused by underlying motor/neurological, structural, or sensory/perceptual issues and include:

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Motor/Neurological Disorders:</strong> Conditions like Dysarthria, where muscle weakness or incoordination impacts speech, and Apraxia, which involves difficulty in planning and coordinating the movements required for speech.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Structural Disorders:</strong> Issues such as cleft palate or conditions resulting from trauma or surgery that affect the physical ability to produce speech sounds.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Sensory/Perceptual Disorders:</strong> Conditions like hearing impairments, which affect the ability to perceive and produce sounds accurately.</p>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Functional Speech Sound Disorders</font></strong>

These disorders often have no known cause and include:

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Articulation Disorders:</strong> Errors in producing individual speech sounds, such as distortions or substitutions.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:4%; margin-right:4%;"">• <strong>Phonological Disorders:</strong> Patterns of predictable, rule-based errors (e.g., fronting, stopping, or final consonant deletion) that impact multiple speech sounds.</p>

<strong><font size=""+1"">Why Early and Accurate Diagnosis Matters</font></strong>

The earlier a SSD is diagnosed the earlier intervention can begin. Early diagnosis of SSDs can also help identify co-occurring language disorders. Research shows that forty percent of children with SSDs also present with language disorders. This makes communicating clearly even more of a challenge. A timely diagnosis is essential for helping students learn to clearly communicate and succeed academically.

Accurately diagnosing the type of Speech Sound disorder, as described above, is key to helping us select the most effective treatment approach for each child. For example, using a phonological approach to treat a phonological disorder will likely be more effective than using an articulation approach.

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ssd_quote.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""335"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3842"" />

<strong><font size=""+1"">The Prevalence of Speech Sound Disorders</font></strong>

Speech-Language Pathologists have plenty of opportunities to practice early and accurate diagnosis. Research shows that up 24.6% of school-aged children experience speech delays or SSDs. And of the children on a school-based SLP’s caseload, 92% of them have a speech sound disorder (ASHA 2022 schools survey). These statistics highlight the importance of promptly and accurately diagnosing SSDs and implementing evidence-based treatments.

<strong><font size=""+1"">Tools to Support SLPs in Diagnosis and Treatment</font></strong>

We recognize the challenges SLPs face in the assessment and treatment of SSDs. To support you in this process, we’ve developed practical, evidence-based tools like <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-test-center-hive-for-ipad-iphone-mac/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Test Center Hive</a> and <a href=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/articulation-station-hive-for-ipad-and-iphone/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Articulation Station Hive</a>. These resources are designed to streamline the assessment and treatment process, enabling you to support the children you work with more effectively and efficiently.

Having clear, up-to-date references can also make a significant difference in your practice.

"Articulation Station Hive Update 1.7 - Multisyllabic Word Activity, Numbered Matching Game Cards & More!",articulation-station-hive-update-1-7-multisyllabic-word-activity-numbered-matching-game-cards-more,Little Bee,2025-03-13,App Store,https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/update_1.7_main.png,"<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/update_1.7_main.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""475"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3972"" />

Update 1.7 is packed with exciting new features designed to enhance your therapy sessions! 🎉

Here’s a look at what’s new:

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Articulation_Station_Hive_Update_1.7-1-4.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""656"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4068"" />

<strong>Multisyllabic Word Activity</strong>
Have you ever worked on the initial “w” sound, only to run into a tricky word like ""watermelon"" that leaves your student struggling with all those syllables? We have the perfect solution!

<img src=""https://www.littlebeespeech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Articulation_Station_Hive_Update_1.7-2-6.png"" alt="""" width=""690"" height=""425"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-4069"" />

Now, when using word-level flashcards, simply tap on the yellow syllables icon in the top right corner of the card, and the word will be broken up into syllables. You can highlight and practice each syllable separately, making it easier for students to master complex words. This activity is a game changer!

<strong>Numbered Matching Game Cards</strong>
Teletherapists, this one’s for you! We’ve introduced an option to add numbers to the back of matching cards. This allows students to verbally indicate which cards they want the therapist to turn over—enhancing engagement and making remote therapy sessions smoother than ever.

<em>* This feature must be turned on in the app settings.</em>

<strong>Auditory Bombardment Mode</strong>
We’re thrilled to introduce auditory bombardment—a powerful tool to increase students’ exposure to target sounds. With this setting enabled, students will hear the correct production of a sound repetitively as they swipe through flashcards, play matching games, spin through phrases and sentences, and listen to stories. 

Auditory Bombardment is also an excellent way to help young learners expand their vocabulary while reinforcing correct speech patterns.

<em>* This feature must be turned on in the app settings.</em>

<strong>Enhanced Syllable Spinners</strong>
Our Syllable Spinners now have an exciting new function: the ability to lock individual syllables for more targeted practice. For example, if you’re working on final o͞o syllables and want extra practice with the word “whoo,” you can lock the “whoo” syllable in place while continuing to spin the others. This allows for combinations like whoo-moo, whoo-dew, whoo-shoe, or even whoo-coo-zoo, whoo-chew-shoe, etc. This flexibility makes targeted syllable practice even more effective!

<strong>Easier Session Management</strong>
We know mistakes happen, especially when managing multiple students. To make session organization easier, we’ve added a feature that allows you to move multiple sessions at once from one student to another.

For instance, imagine you have two students named Sophia on your caseload, and you accidentally saved three sessions to Sophia M. instead of Sophia H. No problem! Simply tap the Edit button at the bottom of the scores overview screen, select the sessions you want to move, select Move, and transfer them to the correct student. It’s that easy!

Thank you for being part of our Hive! Your feedback helps us continue to improve, and we can’t wait to bring you even more updates in the future.

Happy practicing!
